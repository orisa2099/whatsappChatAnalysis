13/03/2019, 23:03 - Oluwatobi K: I prefer Liverpool win EPL than City tho..

They are still poor
13/03/2019, 23:07 - Korede: But they are on top.
13/03/2019, 23:07 - Korede: Last week they still won 6-0.
13/03/2019, 23:08 - SUG: Not like the bayern that will be toping with 18 points by now
13/03/2019, 23:08 - Korede: We are just better than them. 💁🏾‍♂
13/03/2019, 23:08 - Oluwatobi K: Let's be frank sir... I know you guys are good and trying against the elite...

Just that you'll easily bottle it against those that qualified for the quarter final.
13/03/2019, 23:08 - Korede: Times change.
13/03/2019, 23:08 - Oluwatobi K: Exactly my point
13/03/2019, 23:08 - SUG: Thas just it

They are weak
13/03/2019, 23:08 - Korede: What elite?! We're those elite not there last season?! 💁🏾‍♂
13/03/2019, 23:08 - Korede: *were
13/03/2019, 23:09 - Oluwatobi K: You bottled it last season sir... Against Madrid.
13/03/2019, 23:09 - Korede: So you are thinking I can't beat any of those teams that qualified also?! 😆
See this one ooo.
13/03/2019, 23:10 - SUG: Ajax
13/03/2019, 23:10 - Korede: Only Barca and Juve can be classed as the so-called "elite".
13/03/2019, 23:10 - Oluwatobi K: Qualified for the Champions League Quarterfinals:

Ajax (Holland)
Porto (Portugal)
Man Utd (England)
Tottenham (England)
Juventus (Italy)
Man City (England)
Barcelona (Spain)
Liverpool (England)
13/03/2019, 23:10 - Korede: And I can't beat any of these teams?! 
You must be joking.
13/03/2019, 23:11 - Korede: As it stands, anyone can win this thing.
13/03/2019, 23:11 - Oluwatobi K: Forget it sir... You'll strugle against the EPL Teams that qualified.. Is not Liverpool..💁🏾‍♂
13/03/2019, 23:11 - Josh: I totally agree
13/03/2019, 23:11 - Korede: Same way you're struggling against rennes 🤦🏾‍♂😪.
13/03/2019, 23:11 - Josh: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
13/03/2019, 23:11 - Oluwatobi K: Talking Generally as per say this is "Football" yes..
13/03/2019, 23:12 - Korede: We will see na. When does struggling mean you won't still win. 💁🏾‍♂
13/03/2019, 23:12 - Oluwatobi K: I never argued that... And I'm not saying arsenal will win UEL..Neither I'm i talking base on Banter..

We're just discussing football here
13/03/2019, 23:13 - Korede: And I'm telling you not to write off or down cast any team. Especially Liverpool.
13/03/2019, 23:13 - SUG: Liverpool is good
13/03/2019, 23:13 - Korede: As any of the other English teams done something spectacular 💁🏾‍♂

13/03/2019, 23:15 - SUG: Liverpool is like amaka
13/03/2019, 23:15 - Korede: It will be difficult for any team to beat anybody.
13/03/2019, 23:15 - Korede: Even Ajax, Porto will be tough.
13/03/2019, 23:16 - Oluwatobi K: As a matter of fact, Klop and hus team has really impressed me this season.. Just like they did last season.
13/03/2019, 23:16 - Oluwatobi K: Sure..
13/03/2019, 23:16 - SUG: Normal 

But against those english  teams oooo

Liverpool can be weak

Especially to the manchesters
13/03/2019, 23:16 - Korede: Oh please. Like they have it easy against us.
13/03/2019, 23:17 - Korede: You people be analysing there ooo. Don't go and focus on preparing for your UEL.
13/03/2019, 23:17 - Oluwatobi K: I just wish they win something this season sha...

But please if you want to ja, ja early.. So that you can focus on EPL..

29/04/2019, 17:16 - Oye: Firstly the tag says don't open
Secondly, yours is worse cause you went ahead with intention
29/04/2019, 17:17 - Oye: Prince might have intentionally done it but at least there's a possibility he didn't
29/04/2019, 17:17 - Okiki Bello: What if i didn't know the spoilers are true?
29/04/2019, 17:17 - Okiki Bello: What if i thought it was just jokes..
29/04/2019, 17:17 - Oye: Why will you post it anyway
29/04/2019, 17:18 - Oye: And I have watched it so it definitely is true
29/04/2019, 17:18 - Okiki Bello: Moreover, it's something that has been spreading all over twitter..
29/04/2019, 17:18 - Okiki Bello: I didn't even know it was true..
29/04/2019, 17:18 - Oye: And did I go to check twitter
29/04/2019, 17:20 - Oye: If you knew or didn't you should not have posted it
29/04/2019, 17:20 - Ayodele Adewale: You knew they were
29/04/2019, 17:20 - Okiki Bello: I didn't know..
29/04/2019, 17:20 - Ayodele Adewale: You just wanted to ruin it for everyone
29/04/2019, 17:21 - Okiki Bello: Ighalo is my witness. I asked him immediately, when you guys attacked.. If everything happened.
29/04/2019, 17:21 - Ayodele Adewale: You got it from Twitter didn't you
29/04/2019, 17:21 - Okiki Bello: It's the same thing Prince did...
29/04/2019, 17:21 - Oye: Okiki if you got it from twitter you intentionally seemed out spoilers
29/04/2019, 17:21 - Ayodele Adewale: Anyways I didn't read it
I just muted the group
29/04/2019, 17:22 - Oye: *seeked
29/04/2019, 17:22 - Ayodele Adewale: Nope 
With Prince you had a choice to download or not
29/04/2019, 17:22 - Okiki Bello: Now that we have all watched it.. We are sha fine.
29/04/2019, 17:22 - Okiki Bello: I never had a choice. My app was on auto-download.
29/04/2019, 17:23 - Oye: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 17:23 - Oye: Just shot up there
29/04/2019, 17:23 - Okiki Bello: So if i posted a video of the last scene here.. You people still wouldn't attack me..
29/04/2019, 17:24 - Oye: If you say don't open
29/04/2019, 17:24 - Ayodele Adewale: Ever heard of karma
29/04/2019, 17:24 - Oye: We will not attack you
29/04/2019, 17:24 - Okiki Bello: Why would you send something to a group with a caption "Don't open"?
29/04/2019, 17:25 - Okiki Bello: I know people here downloaded it.. And watched.
29/04/2019, 17:25 - Ayodele Adewale: Plus not everyone hasn't seen endgame
29/04/2019, 17:25 - Oye: Because everyone is going to know it's a spoiler
29/04/2019, 17:25 - Oye: And we will open with our own free will
29/04/2019, 17:25 - Ayodele Adewale: Plus nobody sent whoever opens it not to have self control
29/04/2019, 17:25 - Okiki Bello: Wow!!! What if it was one of those porno video or audio prince use to send.
29/04/2019, 17:25 - Oye: And you did it on the opening week
29/04/2019, 17:26 - Ayodele Adewale: Nobody used your hand to press download
29/04/2019, 17:26 - Ayodele Adewale: You can't justify what you did
29/04/2019, 17:26 - Okiki Bello: You people are just partial, jare..
29/04/2019, 17:27 - Oye: Mother fucker... If I know you uncles I would have asked them to give you a knock that will cause alarm in your head for a week
29/04/2019, 17:27 - Ayodele Adewale: Nope
You are just looking for justification for messing up Endgame for people
29/04/2019, 17:27 - Okiki Bello: So if i had sent videos of endgame spoilers. With dont open.. You people won't still come for me..
29/04/2019, 17:27 - Okiki Bello: 🤣🤣🤣
29/04/2019, 17:28 - Okiki Bello: Big Joe. I am not joking
29/04/2019, 17:28 - Oye: And you think I am
29/04/2019, 17:29 - Okiki Bello: Something that i haven't watched.. I don't even know if it was true. Someone in the comment section said it ain't true.
29/04/2019, 17:29 - Oye: Buying a ticket to watch a movie in advance and getting spoilt for me when I was watching it in opening weekend and you think I was OK with it
29/04/2019, 17:29 - Okiki Bello: When you guys started talking. I immediately had to ask Ighalo..
29/04/2019, 17:30 - Okiki Bello: Who confirmed it all happened..
29/04/2019, 17:30 - Okiki Bello: Overall, i never expected IronMan to die.. I thought the spoiler wasn't even real.
29/04/2019, 17:31 - Okiki Bello: How about people who wrote it on status and uploaded videos of Black panther coming back..
29/04/2019, 17:32 - Oye: They wrote it on their own page... And I'll probably stop following selfish assholes like that
29/04/2019, 17:32 - Oye: It's OK okiki, nothing can change the past
29/04/2019, 17:33 - Oye: Just own it... You intentionally wanted to ruin it for everyone
29/04/2019, 17:33 - Okiki Bello: I got to know it hurt you guys so much.. I am so sorry. I never really wanted to spoil it. I hate spoilers, too.. Hope you all forgive me.
29/04/2019, 17:33 - Okiki Bello: No.

29/04/2019, 19:28 - Prince: Wait for the battle for the throne
29/04/2019, 22:10 - Korede: Guys please I have questions concerning GOT. 

Why was the Night King so particular about Bran? I don't understand fully. 

Melisandre's death (the red witch). 

@15717233417 @2348165314296 @2348167554754 etc. 

Thank you! 🤗
29/04/2019, 22:11 - Okiki Bello: Bran said if the Night King kills wants to erase the memories of everyone..
29/04/2019, 22:12 - Okiki Bello: You know bran has the memories. So killing Bran would be faster in wiping out the human race (I guess)
29/04/2019, 22:12 - Orisa: Expatriate
29/04/2019, 22:13 - Korede: Yeah. I remember that. 
Thanks a lot. 
But is that the only reason?
29/04/2019, 22:15 - Oye: True
29/04/2019, 22:16 - Okiki Bello: Cancel the if and kills, pls... Error.
29/04/2019, 22:16 - Oye: Yes because he wants to erase the history of westeros
29/04/2019, 22:17 - Orisa: Ok
29/04/2019, 22:17 - Okiki Bello: He said he wants to erase the world and Bran is the memory!
29/04/2019, 22:18 - Oye: The red priestess job is done.
29/04/2019, 22:18 - Oye: She's an old woman... And that necklace kept her young
29/04/2019, 22:19 - Korede: Oh.
29/04/2019, 22:19 - Okiki Bello: I believe the red priestess just wanted to use the dothrakis as bait.. So all others won't do the same.
29/04/2019, 22:19 - Prince: Now that we are talking about GOT
29/04/2019, 22:19 - Korede: Correct!
29/04/2019, 22:19 - Oye: And since her job is done she removed the necklace
29/04/2019, 22:19 - Prince: When do we start talking about avengers too
29/04/2019, 22:19 - Korede: Figured. I loved her though.
29/04/2019, 22:19 - Korede: Next month.
29/04/2019, 22:20 - Korede: When we've all watched it. Everyone.
29/04/2019, 22:20 - Oye: What kind of love
29/04/2019, 22:20 - Korede: 😭
29/04/2019, 22:20 - Prince: Again nobody is talking about that Samuel tarley that made the Lord commander die...instead of he imbecile to hide
29/04/2019, 22:21 - Prince: Ok
29/04/2019, 22:21 - Okiki Bello: True.. Samwell Tarley cost Edd his life
29/04/2019, 22:21 - Korede: What she did actually?! Fan Love. 
She lit everywhere on fire.
29/04/2019, 22:22 - Okiki Bello: He was been helped severally. There was a scene where Jon wanted to save him, but had to leave him and fight for his own safety first
29/04/2019, 22:22 - Oye: That was super cool
29/04/2019, 22:22 - Korede: Jora and Lyanna Mormont 
THEON 
Edd 
Melisandre 
Beric 
HEROES!
29/04/2019, 22:22 - Korede: Theon went out like a champ!
29/04/2019, 22:22 - Oye: Not his own safety... He wanted to reach the night king
29/04/2019, 22:23 - Korede: Really was. I was vibrating when she did that. 🤭
29/04/2019, 22:23 - Oye: Saving one person solves nothing
29/04/2019, 22:23 - Korede: Exactly.
29/04/2019, 22:23 - Okiki Bello: Melisandre had prophecies and quite a few came true.
29/04/2019, 22:24 - Korede: Except that person is Bran.
29/04/2019, 22:24 - Oye: True
29/04/2019, 22:24 - Korede: Brown Eyes who?

29/04/2019, 22:27 - Korede: Confirmed.
29/04/2019, 22:27 - Ayodele Adewale: She wasn't on the tree
29/04/2019, 22:27 - Okiki Bello: How did she jump that high!!??

I loved him.
29/04/2019, 22:28 - Korede: Where was she? 😨
29/04/2019, 22:28 - Okiki Bello: Did she fly?
29/04/2019, 22:28 - Korede: Abi na superspeed she take pass those guys?!
29/04/2019, 22:28 - Ayodele Adewale: You guys don't pay attention

29/04/2019, 22:29 - Okiki Bello: Wow!!

29/04/2019, 22:29 - Korede: Let me check sef.
29/04/2019, 22:29 - Okiki Bello: And you, too!!
29/04/2019, 22:29 - Ayodele Adewale: They literally showed how quiet and fast she moves in earlier scenes
29/04/2019, 22:30 - Orisa: Wah about the jump
29/04/2019, 22:30 - Okiki Bello: Really?? The jump, nko?
29/04/2019, 22:30 - Ayodele Adewale: Remember when she snuck up on Jon in episode 1
29/04/2019, 22:30 - Korede: We saw. But that was extremely fast.
29/04/2019, 22:31 - Orisa: That jump was high to move from ground level
29/04/2019, 22:31 - Korede: One of the generals felt breeze move past him but... That's was ARYA? My goodness. 🙆🏾‍♂
29/04/2019, 22:31 - Ayodele Adewale: Exactly
29/04/2019, 22:31 - Korede: Takes a lot to sneak up on the Night King.
29/04/2019, 22:31 - Okiki Bello: Yes.. She could have.. But that jump?
29/04/2019, 22:31 - Korede: She's a BLOODY super HERO then.
29/04/2019, 22:32 - Orisa: I gaz watch this part again
29/04/2019, 22:33 - Ayodele Adewale: That's why we didn't see her sneak up on him
29/04/2019, 22:33 - Okiki Bello: The guy felt a breeze, true. But arya wasn't jumping like someone who jumped from a ground level. She jumped like she already on a tree
29/04/2019, 22:33 - Korede: Awesome.
29/04/2019, 22:34 - Ayodele Adewale: She was trained by the top assassins in the realm oh
29/04/2019, 22:34 - Okiki Bello: Let's agree she snuck up on them and climbed a tree, then jumped
29/04/2019, 22:34 - Korede: She actually made the jump from the ground moving at top speed. Not that high too. 
The nigh king isn't exactly on the tall side.
29/04/2019, 22:34 - Korede: Nah. She didn't climb the tree. She jumped from the ground up.
29/04/2019, 22:34 - Ayodele Adewale: Oga rationalise it how you want
29/04/2019, 22:35 - Korede: Watch again. I just did.
29/04/2019, 22:35 - Okiki Bello: Abi..at last, she sha killed the Night King
29/04/2019, 22:36 - Oye: She's an assassin... If you see an assassin coming the sender should ask for refund
29/04/2019, 22:36 - Okiki Bello: I didn't know that Valyrian steel Bran gave Arya was still going to be for more greater.. I thought it was only for Littlefinger's throat..
29/04/2019, 22:36 - Oye: She's stealth mode always. As they've shown you don't see or hear her coming
29/04/2019, 22:37 - Korede: True. 😆😆😆
29/04/2019, 22:37 - Korede: True!
29/04/2019, 22:38 - Okiki Bello: And littlefinger was among the dead that came up.. Who saw him?
29/04/2019, 22:38 - Ayodele Adewale: You only hear her when she wants to be heard
29/04/2019, 22:40 - Orisa: 😳, egbon

29/04/2019, 23:15 - Ayodele Adewale: By the way we do not agree to this
29/04/2019, 23:16 - Ayodele Adewale: Just see the scene one more time and it's obvious she jumped from the ground

29/04/2019, 23:20 - Ayodele Adewale: It's kinda late to start talking about that one fa
29/04/2019, 23:20 - Prince: I have not seen it
29/04/2019, 23:20 - Prince: Reviews online says it is boring
29/04/2019, 23:20 - Orisa: Not really tho
29/04/2019, 23:20 - Orisa: Kinda owk
30/04/2019, 11:12 - Korede: Guys, please Why did the Night King die so easily?! Why?!
30/04/2019, 11:13 - Korede: <Media omitted>
30/04/2019, 12:11 - SUG: 🙄🙄
01/05/2019, 09:37 - Korede added Eniola
01/05/2019, 09:40 - Eniola: Welcome ladies and gentlemen
01/05/2019, 09:41 - Eniola: Today is the battle of two elephants in one of the greatest competition of all time
01/05/2019, 09:41 - SUG: Where lady dey here bayi
01/05/2019, 09:41 - Eniola: Who do you think is gonna come out successful tonight?
01/05/2019, 09:42 - Eniola: Korede na one of them
01/05/2019, 09:42 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
01/05/2019, 09:42 - Eniola: 🚶🏽🚶🏽🚶🏽
01/05/2019, 09:49 - Korede: 🤦🏾‍♂
I added you, I will remove you, bloody Wight.
01/05/2019, 09:50 - Eniola: 🤣😂
01/05/2019, 09:50 - Eniola: Na joke na
01/05/2019, 09:51 - Korede: As a Liverpool Fan, LIVERPOOL #YNWA 
As an Objective football fan, LIVERPOOL. 
Can't help myself. 🤷🏾‍♂
But anybody can win sha. Especially when you have Lionel "Stark" Messi. 😰😭🤦🏾‍♂
01/05/2019, 09:51 - Korede: Is there anyway Messi doesn't play today??! Ehn?!!
01/05/2019, 09:57 - Eniola: Yeah you have a point though
Anybody that will win will have to fight for it, it won't be a write off like the one that happened in quarter final..
The bother team are complete in their forwards 
Messi-suarez-coutinho
Salah-firminho-mane
In the defence, Liverpool have a better defence than them
In the midfield, they have a better midfield than Liverpool 
The match will be decided by how well the forwards from the both teams will be able to convert their chances
01/05/2019, 09:57 - Joshua Ighalo: Liverpool don't need to do anything extraordinary to hold messi because honestly he can't be contained. Best thing is to play their game without showing any form of respect to barca especially hitting them well on the counter since they won't be holding possession.
01/05/2019, 09:59 - SUG: You get it brother
01/05/2019, 10:00 - Korede: Exactly. There's no point in trying to Single out Messi, only Arya, Night King and Thanos can hold him. 
We will just have to play Barca as a whole and take our chances.
01/05/2019, 10:01 - Korede: I know that guy will definitely have impact, if he scores two, Liverpool should score Four. 😆
01/05/2019, 10:02 - SUG: Korede 
With all this GOT
01/05/2019, 10:03 - Korede: I'm a geek, it's what I do. 
Until I exhaust everything GOT gene in me. 😆😌
01/05/2019, 10:03 - Eniola: Naaaaahhh 
Two is much
01/05/2019, 10:07 - Joshua Ighalo: Liverpool don't do well when not in possession unlike last season. The two games where they didn't have possession (against Mancity) they didn't play well at all. And that's where my fear for liverpool sets in. And honestly barca has a better midfield than liverpool as anyone on the barca team can score. If they can tap into that liverpool gene of last season that has less of the ball but were ruthless on counter attack then they have a shot today
01/05/2019, 10:09 - Korede: 😌
01/05/2019, 10:49 - Okiki Bello: Were!! 😃🤣🤣🤣
01/05/2019, 10:49 - Korede: 😏
01/05/2019, 10:50 - Okiki Bello: Tbh.. I don't care about today's match because Barcelona are going to be playing in the final.
01/05/2019, 10:50 - Korede: Copa del Ray???
01/05/2019, 10:50 - Okiki Bello: Champions League!
01/05/2019, 10:52 - Korede: 😏
01/05/2019, 14:14 - Oye: Are you suggesting that Liverpool comes to camp nu to win?
01/05/2019, 14:15 - Okiki Bello: 😂😂
01/05/2019, 14:44 - Korede: Yes na. We can win there. 😌
You expect me to say no?! TAH!
01/05/2019, 14:45 - Korede: Although that na house sef na die.
01/05/2019, 15:11 - Oye: Lol... It's today you will know that Messi doesn't need to see post to score in his house
01/05/2019, 15:11 - Oye: I'm not making mouth since its camp my first... And I know away battle is always hard
01/05/2019, 15:12 - Oye: But Messi has promised us lol
01/05/2019, 15:37 - SUG: They so much believe in this messi, and injury can hook him today oo 😏
01/05/2019, 15:39 - Korede: Please he should not do that. 🥺😭
01/05/2019, 15:39 - Korede: It usually is.
01/05/2019, 15:39 - Korede: 🥺
01/05/2019, 15:39 - Korede: If I say Amen now they will say I'm wishing someone bad.
01/05/2019, 15:40 - SUG: Anything can happen now 😏
01/05/2019, 15:40 - Oye: Well done! I see your style style olote

01/05/2019, 15:41 - SUG: Una talk to much 
Seriously that barca is empty without him
01/05/2019, 15:42 - Korede: He will collect red card today and miss the return leg. 🙈
01/05/2019, 15:43 - Oye: It's like you have superman in your team and you want flash to be serious!
01/05/2019, 15:43 - Korede: But honestly ehn, that guy can, will and should make VVD look like a Version of Smalling. 🥺
01/05/2019, 15:43 - Oye: If he's not there... The others will rise up
01/05/2019, 15:43 - Korede: 😂😂😂 
So true!
01/05/2019, 15:44 - Korede: Yes, but against Darkseid, they need their Superman.
01/05/2019, 15:44 - Korede: 😌
01/05/2019, 15:44 - SUG: Who abeg

01/05/2019, 15:44 - SUG: So true
01/05/2019, 15:45 - SUG: The guy is magical

01/05/2019, 16:53 - Oye: Use your wish wisely... Pray arsenal wins Europa or enters Top 4
01/05/2019, 16:53 - Oye: We miss you in UCL
01/05/2019, 16:54 - Korede: We really do. At least Bayern does.
01/05/2019, 16:55 - SUG: Waka 🖐🏼
01/05/2019, 16:55 - Korede: 🙃
01/05/2019, 16:55 - SUG: 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
01/05/2019, 17:16 - Okiki Bello: This Bayern cannot beat this Arsenal
01/05/2019, 17:21 - Korede: 😂😂😂
Even me I'll see brace against this Arsenal. 
Pata pata both of them will lose the match. 😂
01/05/2019, 17:25 - Okiki Bello: I am talking about the full Arsenal squad and i remember you struggling against them
01/05/2019, 17:26 - Korede: Struggling. 😆
Full. Half. Quarter. Dead. Undead. They are pipe.
01/05/2019, 17:26 - Okiki Bello: Says the man who hasn't won a shit!
01/05/2019, 17:27 - Korede: Here we go again.
01/05/2019, 17:27 - Okiki Bello: Who bottled an eight point lead.. Arákùnrin, Your team is the real pipe
01/05/2019, 17:27 - Korede: Yen yen yen yen yen yen.
01/05/2019, 17:28 - Korede: Who squandered a 10+ game unbeaten run only to be in 5th???!
01/05/2019, 17:28 - Korede: You are calling Liverpool pipe. 🤦🏾‍♂
01/05/2019, 17:29 - Korede: Deluded Wight.
01/05/2019, 17:29 - Okiki Bello: Get your facts right.. It wasn't even 10
01/05/2019, 17:29 - Korede: Did you see the +???
01/05/2019, 17:30 - Okiki Bello: And the 22 unbeaten run still had Arsenal at 5th.. Arsenal didn't move a bit up the table
01/05/2019, 17:30 - Korede: And dude I was referring to the league alone.
01/05/2019, 17:30 - Korede: Stop rushing to type, relax.
01/05/2019, 17:31 - Okiki Bello: It still wouldn't hurt like bottling an eight point lead.
01/05/2019, 17:31 - Korede: Is this the only thing you've got?? 'cos it's selling out.
01/05/2019, 17:32 - Okiki Bello: Oh.. Sorry.. Bottle
01/05/2019, 17:33 - Korede: How I got into this banter with someone who isn't sure where he belongs to baffles me. 😪

08/05/2019, 10:56 - Prince: Too much 

Machining 
Computer programming 

We didn't study computer engineering and mech together
08/05/2019, 10:56 - Prince: Or lemme say it does not work like that in Nigeria abi is there anywhere like that
08/05/2019, 11:00 - Ayodele Adewale: It doesn't mean you studied computer engineering
08/05/2019, 11:00 - Ayodele Adewale: You should just have a good knowledge of programming
08/05/2019, 11:01 - Ayodele Adewale: A good number of programmers never entered a computer science or engineering class in their entire lives
08/05/2019, 11:01 - Prince: Ok then
08/05/2019, 11:02 - Ayodele Adewale: Yeah
08/05/2019, 14:19 - Joshua Ighalo: Computer programming is required in any form of engineering over here
08/05/2019, 14:36 - Okiki Bello: Wawu!! I think it's time to start!
08/05/2019, 14:42 - Prince: My brother that tin de bring mad money apart from school sef
08/05/2019, 14:43 - Prince: @2348167554754
08/05/2019, 14:44 - Okiki Bello: Wawu!!!
08/05/2019, 15:19 - Orisa: Just start with python, I think it's the simplest we can go fast with sha
08/05/2019, 15:20 - Ayodele Adewale: Do you know python?
08/05/2019, 15:21 - Orisa: Not really óò, just little started a while ago stopped again
08/05/2019, 15:21 - Orisa: Wen I asked a programmer fwend
08/05/2019, 15:21 - Orisa: He actually advised me to start with it sha
08/05/2019, 15:23 - Ayodele Adewale: Truth is picking which language you want to learn depends on which aspect you want to go into
08/05/2019, 15:24 - Orisa: Yea
08/05/2019, 15:24 - Ayodele Adewale: Because there are several programming languages out there and they are all best suited for one thing or the other
08/05/2019, 15:25 - Ayodele Adewale: It won't make sense learning something then you realise you want to go into a field and what you know is not best suited to it
08/05/2019, 15:25 - Orisa: Shebi twas u that told me Matlab was a programming language suited 4 wah u wanted to do

I neva knew that stuff was 1 untill u told me
08/05/2019, 15:25 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol
08/05/2019, 15:26 - Ayodele Adewale: Like the one I am learning now I hadn't heard of it before I started working
08/05/2019, 15:27 - Orisa: The one u told me about shey
08/05/2019, 15:27 - Ayodele Adewale: Yeah
08/05/2019, 15:27 - Orisa: As in

Won't be surprised if someone comes up. And tell me excel sef na programming language
08/05/2019, 15:28 - Ayodele Adewale: It does have it's own language
08/05/2019, 15:28 - Orisa: But all is well sha
08/05/2019, 15:29 - Orisa: Ehn ehn, I. Neva talk. Finish
08/05/2019, 15:30 - Orisa: U c dz data science of a thing

God dey ooo

So tey u do education courses sef in skul u will need a bit knowledge on it
08/05/2019, 15:30 - Ayodele Adewale: Like for those that want to major in Control Engineering you will have to know MATLAB 
Computer Security self uses MATLAB 
Structures MATLAB
08/05/2019, 15:30 - Timi: Which lang. is that?
08/05/2019, 15:30 - Ayodele Adewale: ABAP for SAP
08/05/2019, 15:30 - Joshua Ighalo: God bless you. It could be as an engineer or as a web developer. The choice of programming language differ
08/05/2019, 15:30 - Ayodele Adewale: I still to do something in this field and that's python
08/05/2019, 15:30 - Timi: First time I'm hearing about this

08/05/2019, 15:32 - Orisa: Broz no b u, first time I heard it from him to had to check up on it
08/05/2019, 15:32 - Ayodele Adewale: For those of you that are looking into programming just to make money
08/05/2019, 15:33 - Joshua Ighalo: Una computer people don mad finish sha
08/05/2019, 15:33 - Ayodele Adewale: But just know it's not easy

08/05/2019, 15:35 - Joshua Ighalo: Sent shivers down my spine for 3 days
08/05/2019, 15:35 - Ayodele Adewale: You spend 2hours writing a code and it fails to run then spend another 10 hours debugging only to find it's a comma or a full stop that's the problem
08/05/2019, 15:35 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol
Welcome to our world
08/05/2019, 15:35 - Prince: Well You want to make money in the crypto space ...grab your python or java if ya head de hot
08/05/2019, 15:35 - Orisa: Am. Like dem no. Just add computer engineering to all our courses jn skul let's know we doing two degres syd by syd
08/05/2019, 15:36 - Prince: Well MATLAB na scam
08/05/2019, 15:36 - Orisa: Lol

08/05/2019, 15:36 - Joshua Ighalo: He's right
08/05/2019, 15:36 - Ayodele Adewale: Tell that to those making money from it
08/05/2019, 15:37 - Joshua Ighalo: You can't even know which is harder between writing a fresh code and debugging the code
08/05/2019, 15:37 - Prince: Never heard of this shit

08/05/2019, 15:38 - Ayodele Adewale: Check the link I posted
08/05/2019, 15:38 - Ayodele Adewale: Was going to say then maybe electrical students
08/05/2019, 15:39 - Prince: App generally leave system out of it

08/05/2019, 15:42 - Prince: That means all u need is know how to code and you can find every other language easy to some extent....I de ask
08/05/2019, 15:42 - Prince: I want the one wae go serve me well
08/05/2019, 15:43 - Orisa: Just check wah u want to major on and check the languages that support it nooni
08/05/2019, 15:43 - Ayodele Adewale: As I said it depends on what you want
08/05/2019, 15:43 - Joshua Ighalo: My advice is to know the basics

You will need the knowledge of the basics in application projects.
08/05/2019, 15:43 - Timi: Designing gates
08/05/2019, 15:43 - Prince: Gbam

10/05/2019, 09:30 - Ayodele Adewale: Because you and Arsenal got to Europa league final you are now thinking you've arrived
Mtscheew
10/05/2019, 09:30 - Babayomi: 😂😂😂
10/05/2019, 09:31 - Babayomi: Don't worry if you try hard enough next season Europa round of 16 might just be a possibility
10/05/2019, 09:32 - Babayomi: Especially with Shaw, your player of the season and the rest
10/05/2019, 09:34 - Ayodele Adewale: You do know you guys are the underdogs in the Europa finals right
10/05/2019, 09:35 - Ayodele Adewale: This place will not contain me and any set of fans that lose their respective finals
10/05/2019, 09:35 - Babayomi: It doesn't hurt to be.
10/05/2019, 09:35 - Babayomi: I'll still play top tier European football next season

10/05/2019, 09:37 - Korede: 😪
10/05/2019, 09:37 - Ayodele Adewale: You do realise your team won the award for being the less shitty of the shitty top teams this season
10/05/2019, 09:37 - Babayomi: No guarantees, but being in the competition alone gives you a chance to win. Nobody expected Ajax and Tot to come this far
10/05/2019, 09:38 - Babayomi: And your team won? 
The most shitty 😂
10/05/2019, 09:38 - Korede: I am enjoying this. 😆
10/05/2019, 09:38 - Ayodele Adewale: I understand sha seasons and moments of brilliance are far in between for your club therefore any glimpse of glory you guys sniff you will hype till the next comes your way
10/05/2019, 09:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Not arguing this
I accept
10/05/2019, 09:40 - Ayodele Adewale: But what I wouldn't accept is you guys coming here to form all high and mighty like you had exceptional seasons
10/05/2019, 09:41 - Babayomi: Bro!
I was terrible this season,  I made 2 cup finals, 3rd on the log
10/05/2019, 09:41 - Babayomi: But your club? 
Always consixthent
10/05/2019, 09:41 - Ayodele Adewale: If not that most of the top teams in Europe managed not bottle this season Champions League group stage at least one of you guys wouldn't be in the final
10/05/2019, 09:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Why I said you won the award of least shitty club
2 cup finals lol
I am evenly struggling to remember whether it's Carabo Cup or Efl cup it's called nowadays
10/05/2019, 09:43 - Ayodele Adewale: That's how underappreciated the first final you made to and lost is
10/05/2019, 09:44 - Ayodele Adewale: A competition most top clubs don't bother about that they majorly use for bloody youngsters
10/05/2019, 09:44 - Korede: When you guys won it, we no hear word ooo. 💁🏾‍♂

10/05/2019, 10:00 - Korede: No ooo. It's only Babayomi ooo. Me I did not say anything. 🙊

10/05/2019, 10:01 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 10:01 - Korede: Well, this is fun.
10/05/2019, 10:02 - Korede: But let's recall when Manu first got Ole, you'd think they will win Nigerian Elections sef. Dem mumu ehn.
10/05/2019, 10:02 - Ayodele Adewale: By the end of the season he will add we came third and Europa League finalists to his badges
10/05/2019, 10:02 - SUG: You are slapping a man utd fan head 😒
10/05/2019, 10:02 - Korede: Making him a general.
10/05/2019, 10:02 - SUG: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 10:02 - Korede: And BB has hair sef. Babayomi is just disrespectful.
10/05/2019, 10:03 - Ayodele Adewale: Then God forbid they win Europa we will just change the name of the group
10/05/2019, 10:03 - Korede: I swear. 😂
10/05/2019, 10:03 - Korede: To what?! Lai lai. I won't condone such.
10/05/2019, 10:03 - Ayodele Adewale: Because Barcelona decided to save you from being the biggest bottlers this season you are running your mouth
10/05/2019, 10:04 - Ayodele Adewale: Don't worry 
Today is not your day
10/05/2019, 10:04 - SUG: 🙄🙄🙄🙄
10/05/2019, 10:05 - Babayomi: This BB sef
10/05/2019, 10:06 - Okiki Bello: You have a point, my man
10/05/2019, 10:06 - Babayomi: With the way he's talking you'll think Man Utd has won every trophy
10/05/2019, 10:06 - Ayodele Adewale: Was it not you that bottled how many games head start

10/05/2019, 10:08 - Okiki Bello: You know i am Arsenal fan. So drop the crappie
10/05/2019, 10:08 - Ayodele Adewale: Okiki has invented a new English word
10/05/2019, 10:08 - Babayomi: Amen
10/05/2019, 10:08 - Ayodele Adewale: So you are no longer a Madrid or Juve fan
10/05/2019, 10:08 - Okiki Bello: Crap..

10/05/2019, 10:09 - Korede: BB just go and sleep.
10/05/2019, 10:09 - Babayomi: Shaw player of the season 6th
10/05/2019, 10:10 - SUG: If anybody is allowed to talk here

10/05/2019, 10:10 - Okiki Bello: Arsenal fan, Ronaldo fan!!!
10/05/2019, 10:10 - Ayodele Adewale: Better face the prayer and fasting you are presently on so you guys don't bottle another final
P.S: recall Klopp is a serial finals bottler even when he won Bundesliga he bottled finals
10/05/2019, 10:10 - Korede: Mctominay hold Messi 6th.

Until we tell you that u are 6th abi,
10/05/2019, 10:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Try it if you get mind
10/05/2019, 10:11 - Korede: This guy is still talking. 
You don't have hope of bottling a final and you talking. 

See go and meet Wolves fans abeg.
10/05/2019, 10:12 - Ayodele Adewale: I am sure that if not that there must be a winner in a finals 
Chelsea and Arsenal would have found ways of bottling
10/05/2019, 10:12 - SUG: Babayomi has finished everything

There is no point talking to BB self

Everton and wolves are your mate
10/05/2019, 10:12 - Babayomi: It's just said
See what Man Utd have turned our BB into? Oma se o
10/05/2019, 10:12 - Babayomi: *sad
10/05/2019, 10:12 - Korede: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 10:13 - SUG: So sad my brother
10/05/2019, 10:13 - Korede: Manu would've lost to themselves if na only them enter final sef.
10/05/2019, 10:13 - Ayodele Adewale: All you guys can say is we fixed 6th and make 6th place jokes
10/05/2019, 10:13 - SUG: Someone who did not even reach any final
10/05/2019, 10:13 - Babayomi: Yes na. There's a way we'll donate it to the most consixthent team in Europe
10/05/2019, 10:13 - SUG: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 10:13 - Okiki Bello: BB is just confused...
10/05/2019, 10:13 - Korede: What can we do to help him. I miss the old BB 😭😭😭
10/05/2019, 10:14 - Ayodele Adewale: News flash that's all you've said all season
10/05/2019, 10:14 - SUG: This current BB, is like Sanchez
10/05/2019, 10:14 - Korede: 😂😂😂
10/05/2019, 10:14 - SUG: Over confuse
10/05/2019, 10:14 - Okiki Bello: It hurt, olorun. BB is not talking with pride anymore.
10/05/2019, 10:15 - Ayodele Adewale: When you guys finish typing, you guys will go to your little weeping corners and realise all o have said is true
10/05/2019, 10:15 - Babayomi: I do too. 
Honourable, oozes class,  confident, brilliant, witty and all that. But now ☹
10/05/2019, 10:15 - Okiki Bello: You are just bitter, jare!
10/05/2019, 10:15 - SUG: Pride nibo

U started season with 6th, and end with 6th....

It shows consistency
10/05/2019, 10:16 - Korede: Na you are just acting like Tall Tyrion lannister.
10/05/2019, 10:16 - Ayodele Adewale: Which one of you can boldly say they like their team players exactly the way they are
No need to sign players or make changes
Except from City and maybe Liverpool
10/05/2019, 10:16 - SUG: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 10:16 - Korede: I blame Manchester United.
10/05/2019, 10:16 - SUG: Manchester caused what we are seeing
10/05/2019, 10:17 - Okiki Bello: Everyone is looking for a way to improve.. BB.. What is wrong?
10/05/2019, 10:17 - Ayodele Adewale: I am not bitter
If not that you guys are just looking for banter 
And decide to have an intellectual football discussion then you will realise I am saying the truth
10/05/2019, 10:17 - Korede: We need changes. You people need overhauling. 
Shaw your best player this season.
10/05/2019, 10:17 - Korede: Yeh! 🙆🏾‍♂
10/05/2019, 10:18 - Babayomi: Say NO to Man Utd 
They'll destroy you
They're make you go into Depression
10/05/2019, 10:18 - Okiki Bello: You use to present reasonable facts
10/05/2019, 10:18 - SUG: Someone is consistent with 6th


And sure if he was toping too, he would have been consistent
10/05/2019, 10:18 - Babayomi: True
10/05/2019, 10:18 - Korede: I'm sure if we do a competition amongst ourselves now ehn, BB will come sixth.
10/05/2019, 10:19 - Ayodele Adewale: Tell me what I have said this morning that's not reasonable apart from when I joked that our trophy cabinet can buy both Chelsea and Arsenal
10/05/2019, 10:19 - SUG: Was the truth in that

Manchester utd is poor
They didn't make Europe finale 
The are in 6th position

Wasn't that obvious enough
10/05/2019, 10:19 - SUG: U need to see all of them
10/05/2019, 10:20 - Ayodele Adewale: We were not even in Europa League for crying out loud
10/05/2019, 10:20 - Korede: I used to respect Manu but damn! It's just annoying that they've become like this. They pose no competition at all.
10/05/2019, 10:20 - SUG: Will you keep quiet
10/05/2019, 10:20 - SUG: Reach final for champions league na
10/05/2019, 10:20 - SUG: Beat Barcelona like Liverpool did na
10/05/2019, 10:20 - SUG: And u can't
10/05/2019, 10:21 - SUG: Was so obvious than that
10/05/2019, 10:21 - Ayodele Adewale: You guys are not just being sensible this morning
10/05/2019, 10:21 - Okiki Bello: Man utd would need 5 transfer windows to be great again
10/05/2019, 10:21 - Ayodele Adewale: Like your Arsenal can beat Barcelona even with a head start
10/05/2019, 10:21 - Korede: Again. 🙆🏾‍♂
10/05/2019, 10:22 - Korede: One expert said 10.
10/05/2019, 10:22 - SUG: Then I swallow my pride, and keep quiet na
10/05/2019, 10:22 - Kolade FUOYE: 🤣
10/05/2019, 10:22 - Ayodele Adewale: The problem here is that you guys think I saying Manchester United is a good team at the moment
10/05/2019, 10:22 - Korede: This is hurtful. 😭
10/05/2019, 10:22 - Ayodele Adewale: Well sha it might just be a poor understanding of English that's the problem
10/05/2019, 10:22 - SUG: What is doing united is more than 10
10/05/2019, 10:23 - Kolade FUOYE: Lol
10/05/2019, 10:23 - Korede: The third time. 🙆🏾‍♂🙆🏾‍♂🙆🏾‍♂
10/05/2019, 10:23 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
BB will not kill me
10/05/2019, 10:24 - Korede: He has even killed me.
10/05/2019, 10:24 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 10:24 - Okiki Bello: And i am looking at it from a fan aspect
10/05/2019, 10:24 - Ayodele Adewale: Because I am certain somewhere in the discussion I stated Chelsea won the least shitty team trophy
And Babayomi stated that United is the worst shitty team
A statement to which I agreed
10/05/2019, 10:24 - Korede: He has insulted our Intellect, sensibility and understanding of English. 😭😭😭
I'm hurt!
10/05/2019, 10:25 - Ayodele Adewale: The thing is I have accepted Manchester United has serious work to do to become part of the current  great teams again
10/05/2019, 10:25 - Okiki Bello: This is the BB i know..
10/05/2019, 10:25 - Okiki Bello: No spoil am again oh
10/05/2019, 10:26 - Ayodele Adewale: But you Chelsea fans and Arsenal fans because you made it to the Europa league finals are suddenly deluded and think your clubs are still sitting with the big boys
10/05/2019, 10:26 - Korede: After he has yabbed us finish. 😒
10/05/2019, 10:26 - Korede: 🙆🏾‍♂ add delusion to it.
10/05/2019, 10:27 - Babayomi: True. The work starts from getting a Startimes so you can watch your team next season. On behalf of all Chelsea fans we will donate ours to you. 
Signed. 
Thanks
10/05/2019, 10:27 - Ayodele Adewale: Liverpool lost their way and are currently finding their way back to the table but that doesn't mean I won't banter them when necessary
10/05/2019, 10:27 - Ayodele Adewale: Don't need it
Thanks
10/05/2019, 10:27 - SUG: Do u know babayomi attacked you with part glory 

In which u are still saying stylishly
10/05/2019, 10:27 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 10:28 - Korede: 😂😂😂. 
I'm hurt by this one gan.
10/05/2019, 10:28 - Ayodele Adewale: How am I saying it stylishly again
If I talk you will say I am talking
10/05/2019, 10:28 - Korede: 😏
10/05/2019, 10:28 - Korede: Better take it. I feel you'd need it in the long run.
10/05/2019, 10:28 - Ayodele Adewale: @2348106340729 I think you should take your time and read this carefully or maybe ask someone to read it slowly to you
10/05/2019, 10:29 - SUG: We already know u said this
10/05/2019, 10:29 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 10:29 - Okiki Bello: 🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 10:30 - Ayodele Adewale: So which part of that says past glory
10/05/2019, 10:30 - Korede: Someone kill me. 😭
10/05/2019, 10:30 - SUG: We know you have serious work to do, so don't involve Chelsea and  Arsenal, as far as this season is concern to anything compare to yours
10/05/2019, 10:30 - SUG: 🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 10:30 - Okiki Bello: 🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 10:30 - SUG: Babayomi will not kill someone
10/05/2019, 10:31 - Ayodele Adewale: How many away games did Arsenal win this season???
How many times did Chelsea struggle with games this season
10/05/2019, 10:34 - Ayodele Adewale: Funny thing is that I never actually compared United's season to either that of Chelsea or Arsenal
All I did was point out that you guys didn't exactly have exceptional seasons 
Apparently I projected the level of greatness I expected for United (Which we didn't come near this season) to you guys
I am sorry for forgetting that you guys are okay with mediocrity and the odd glimpses of glory once in a while
10/05/2019, 10:35 - Korede: DRACARYS
10/05/2019, 10:35 - Korede: BB All these English is not necessary.
10/05/2019, 10:36 - Ayodele Adewale: I am not satisfied if Manchester United doesn't win at least the league domestically and  get to at least the semis of the champions league losing honourable to whoever their opponents are
10/05/2019, 10:37 - Ayodele Adewale: Are you saying I should have used broken English or Yoruba 
If that is what you are alluding to I'll put that into consideration next time 
Maybe then we will not have pointless arguments
10/05/2019, 10:37 - Babayomi: Ah! So you have never been satisfied for almost a decade now. Oma se o
10/05/2019, 10:38 - Korede: You are so considerate.
10/05/2019, 10:38 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 10:38 - Korede: Take your L and stop confusing us with grammar joor.
10/05/2019, 10:38 - Korede: With time he will grow content.
10/05/2019, 10:39 - Ayodele Adewale: You think everybody grows accustomed to mediocrity like you lot have
10/05/2019, 10:39 - Korede: BB sef ehn. 😆
10/05/2019, 10:40 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 10:40 - Babayomi: Eventually! When he discovers no good can come out of this his club
10/05/2019, 10:40 - Korede: Look at this one ooo. You don't know it's a gradual process. 😂
10/05/2019, 10:40 - SUG: 🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂
Babayomiiiiiii
10/05/2019, 10:41 - SUG: U like giving people smack down🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 10:41 - Korede: By the time you finish 6th for like 3 Consecutive seasons you'll learn to love Europa and accept Wolves or Everton as your fiercest rivals.
10/05/2019, 10:42 - SUG: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 10:43 - Ayodele Adewale: There's no point reasoning with you guys
You guys can do whatever or say whatever makes you happy
10/05/2019, 10:43 - Korede: Retreat.
10/05/2019, 10:43 - Ayodele Adewale: As I said earlier it's not your fault 
Its the gross mismanagement at the top that is causing all this
10/05/2019, 10:44 - Korede: All these English is still not helping your case.
10/05/2019, 10:44 - Ayodele Adewale: Sometimes when people have refused to reason then it best to let them wallow in their self deciet
10/05/2019, 10:45 - Korede: Don't mind them.
10/05/2019, 10:45 - SUG: 🤣🤣😏😏😏😏

10/05/2019, 10:49 - Babayomi: What did I do now 🤷🏼‍♂
10/05/2019, 10:59 - Korede: Absolutely nothing!
10/05/2019, 11:00 - Okiki Bello: What BB is saying is if i understand fully is that Arsenal and Chelsea didn't have a great season. Not as worse as Man utd tho.
10/05/2019, 11:01 - Okiki Bello: He is not disputing the fact that Man utd are a shitty team. But Chelsea and Arsenal did not have a good season to call Man utd shitty. Do i get you, BB?
10/05/2019, 11:02 - Korede: We all got him. This is banter! Whether less shitty or more shitty. Anyone will banter you, even Huddersfield fans.
10/05/2019, 11:03 - SUG: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 11:03 - Kolade FUOYE: Oga ooo.. make una free man utd na😓
🤣
10/05/2019, 11:03 - Korede: See him telling me he'll banter me if I lose the UCL final. 💁🏾‍♂
Out of all the shittiest teams, Manu still wants to banter Liverpool. Is that not insulting?! 💁🏾‍♂
10/05/2019, 11:03 - Okiki Bello: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 11:04 - Korede: ManShitty United!
10/05/2019, 11:04 - SUG: This was all I was saying
10/05/2019, 11:05 - Okiki Bello: You don't know what you are saying.
10/05/2019, 11:05 - Okiki Bello: You were just bantering for bantering sake!
10/05/2019, 11:05 - Korede: Be respectful!
10/05/2019, 11:05 - Korede: 😂
10/05/2019, 11:06 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣
10/05/2019, 11:06 - Korede: It is allowed! 
Even of na "we enter final badge of honor" you get. Banter anyone less.
10/05/2019, 11:06 - Okiki Bello: Ola just started attacking BB because it was BB and everyone was attacking!
10/05/2019, 11:06 - SUG: I was saying he should not be the one to banter us
10/05/2019, 11:06 - Korede: He left himself open Like Rhaegal the dragon. 💁🏾‍♂
10/05/2019, 11:07 - Okiki Bello: 🤦🏽‍♂. Oh no. Korede is about to start!
10/05/2019, 11:07 - SUG: He replied my yesterday post

13/05/2019, 14:03 - Prince: Where is Tyrion?
13/05/2019, 14:03 - Okiki Bello: Looking at the other side, Na Missandei death and Jon betrayal that made Dany mad, sha.
13/05/2019, 14:03 - Prince: No
13/05/2019, 14:04 - Okiki Bello: He would save his twins siblings
13/05/2019, 14:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Jon didn't betray her
13/05/2019, 14:11 - Orisa: That r dead
13/05/2019, 14:13 - Okiki Bello: She felt he did.
13/05/2019, 14:18 - Ayodele Adewale: She felt so doesn't mean he did
13/05/2019, 15:32 - Okiki Bello: I didn't say he did.
13/05/2019, 15:32 - Okiki Bello: She believes he betrayed him. And she might kill Sansa if she is not careful
13/05/2019, 15:33 - Prince: Wat are u saying
13/05/2019, 15:33 - Timi: She can't
13/05/2019, 15:34 - Okiki Bello: He would save Cersei and Jamie.
13/05/2019, 15:34 - Okiki Bello: Why???
13/05/2019, 15:35 - Prince: 😏
13/05/2019, 15:35 - Okiki Bello: He always wanted to save Cersei
13/05/2019, 15:35 - Timi: Dany wicked pass Cersei, Jeffrey and MF Ramsay...
13/05/2019, 15:35 - Ayodele Adewale: She's too far from Winterfell
13/05/2019, 15:36 - Ayodele Adewale: Baba you do realise they were buried alive
13/05/2019, 15:36 - Timi: Yea
13/05/2019, 15:37 - Ayodele Adewale: Plus she would have to kill Jon and Arya first before she can attempt to kill Sansa
13/05/2019, 15:38 - Timi: Yes... She needs to die tho
13/05/2019, 15:38 - Okiki Bello: Well, we can't be too sure
13/05/2019, 15:39 - Ayodele Adewale: The show writers practically confirmed that they died na
13/05/2019, 15:39 - Okiki Bello: So??? How many days would it take her to ride to Winterfell and burn Sansa.. You guys are forgetting that this woman has gone mad
13/05/2019, 15:40 - Prince: Keep guessing
13/05/2019, 15:40 - Okiki Bello: I did not listen to that, sha. I was at work. So i used break to watch and immediately i finished, i just closed it
13/05/2019, 15:40 - Prince: D&D be like kontunu
13/05/2019, 15:41 - Okiki Bello: I believe she can kill Sansa if she wants to. She is a mad queen
13/05/2019, 15:41 - Ayodele Adewale: Ohkay oh
Chief navigator
13/05/2019, 15:41 - Ayodele Adewale: Why would she want to
13/05/2019, 15:41 - Okiki Bello: 🤣
13/05/2019, 15:41 - Ayodele Adewale: She will lose the entire kingdom if she does
13/05/2019, 15:42 - Okiki Bello: She has lost it already now
13/05/2019, 15:42 - Timi: She has lost it already
13/05/2019, 15:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Well technically no
13/05/2019, 15:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Just the people or what is left of the people in kings landing
13/05/2019, 15:44 - Timi: If Arya didn't kill her, snow will
13/05/2019, 15:44 - Ayodele Adewale: The other six kingdoms didn't experience her dark side plus
13/05/2019, 15:45 - Ayodele Adewale: Most of the Lords left are her banner men
13/05/2019, 15:45 - Ayodele Adewale: Then houses that are not on side presently don't even have Lords anymore
13/05/2019, 15:46 - Okiki Bello: They would leave in fear for the rest of their lives..
13/05/2019, 15:46 - Timi: She rules with fear...  In reality she doesn't have any banner man
13/05/2019, 15:46 - Okiki Bello: In fact, she doesn't have people again.
13/05/2019, 15:47 - Timi: Which I feel the north would feel threatened by her
13/05/2019, 15:47 - Ayodele Adewale: She does
Well I can't say Jon will continue to support her
13/05/2019, 15:47 - Okiki Bello: Only Gendry and Jon.
13/05/2019, 15:47 - Ayodele Adewale: Remember she's the only one that has a navy
13/05/2019, 15:47 - Ayodele Adewale: She has highgarden
13/05/2019, 15:48 - Ayodele Adewale: Dorne
13/05/2019, 15:48 - Okiki Bello: In this episode i watched, Baba has lost support in her
13/05/2019, 15:48 - Okiki Bello: You forgot high garden was infiltrated by Jamie.
13/05/2019, 15:49 - Ayodele Adewale: They stole the gold
13/05/2019, 15:49 - Ayodele Adewale: Whatever army is left there is hers
13/05/2019, 15:49 - Timi: The iron fleet will support  snow
13/05/2019, 15:49 - Ayodele Adewale: They stole the gold and left
13/05/2019, 15:49 - Ayodele Adewale: Nope
Theon is no longer there
13/05/2019, 15:49 - Ayodele Adewale: His sister has no such loyalty to the Starks
13/05/2019, 15:50 - Ayodele Adewale: In fact she most probably hates them just like her father
13/05/2019, 15:50 - Ayodele Adewale: And remember she sailed to offer Dany her ships and support
13/05/2019, 15:51 - Timi: Maybe... But I think cos of Theon which might have soft spot for snow
13/05/2019, 15:52 - Ayodele Adewale: Nope
13/05/2019, 15:53 - Ayodele Adewale: A lot of the houses left would most probably not give a rat ass about the carnage that befell Kings Landing
13/05/2019, 15:53 - Ayodele Adewale: That place was the source of sorrow for most of them
13/05/2019, 15:54 - Ayodele Adewale: Only those that witnessed the carnage first hand wouldn't be so swayed to support Dany anymore
13/05/2019, 16:10 - Okiki Bello: No... Samwell Tarley father, Randyl was from Highgarden. The armies of high garden perished on their way from stealing those Gold.
13/05/2019, 16:12 - Ayodele Adewale: They are not from High Garden
13/05/2019, 16:13 - Ayodele Adewale: They were just part of the  Lannister's army that sacked Highgarden
13/05/2019, 16:14 - Ayodele Adewale: It was the Tyrells that were the Lords/Ladies of High Garden
13/05/2019, 16:30 - Okiki Bello: And Randyl Tarley is from highgarden.. BB. I rewatched this whole thing before starting again
13/05/2019, 16:30 - Okiki Bello: Before starting season 8 rather
13/05/2019, 16:31 - Ayodele Adewale: You watched the back of the TV my friend
13/05/2019, 16:32 - Ayodele Adewale: The Tyrells are different from the Tarleys
13/05/2019, 16:32 - Ayodele Adewale: Abeg someone should explain to Okiki
13/05/2019, 16:38 - Okiki Bello: Yes. True.
13/05/2019, 16:38 - Ayodele Adewale: So in what universe are the Tarleys from High Garden
13/05/2019, 16:38 - Okiki Bello: They aee both in High garden
13/05/2019, 16:39 - Ayodele Adewale: No
13/05/2019, 16:39 - Ayodele Adewale: They are not
13/05/2019, 16:40 - Okiki Bello: Search abeg
13/05/2019, 16:40 - Ayodele Adewale: The only reason you think that is in season 7 when Dany's troops attacked Casterly Rock 
Cerci outsmarted them by attacking High Garden
13/05/2019, 16:40 - Ayodele Adewale: And the Tarleys were part of her allies
13/05/2019, 16:41 - Ayodele Adewale: Samuel Tarley is not from HighGarden
13/05/2019, 16:41 - Ayodele Adewale: And his family are not the Lords of High Garden 
Its the Tyrells
13/05/2019, 16:42 - Ayodele Adewale: <Media omitted>
13/05/2019, 16:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Shey you can see for yourself 
The Tarleys are the Lords of Horn Hill
13/05/2019, 16:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Not High Garden
13/05/2019, 16:44 - Ayodele Adewale: I now see why you are confused though
13/05/2019, 16:44 - Ayodele Adewale: They betrayed the Tyrells when they sided with the Lannisters
13/05/2019, 16:44 - Ayodele Adewale: That's why you are thinking they are from High Garden
13/05/2019, 17:49 - Okiki Bello: BB... I am sorry, but for the first time in a while, i am winning an argument against yoh
13/05/2019, 17:49 - Okiki Bello: You.
13/05/2019, 17:49 - Okiki Bello: <Media omitted>
13/05/2019, 17:49 - Okiki Bello: I told you i rewatched this thing
13/05/2019, 17:50 - Okiki Bello: Jamie told Lord Tarley that he should abandon his queen, Olenna and support Cersei..
13/05/2019, 17:50 - Ayodele Adewale: For crying out loud
When I say high garden I mean the castle for crying out loud
13/05/2019, 17:50 - Ayodele Adewale: They are not the Lords of High Garden
13/05/2019, 17:50 - Okiki Bello: Lorf Tarley told him, he grew up with Olenna in highgardens
13/05/2019, 17:50 - Ayodele Adewale: They are just banner men
13/05/2019, 17:51 - Korede: Opari bayii
13/05/2019, 17:51 - Okiki Bello: BB.. See this!
13/05/2019, 17:51 - Okiki Bello: Look at your reply
13/05/2019, 17:52 - Ayodele Adewale: It's just like saying the Theon can be Lord of Winterfell because he grew up there
13/05/2019, 17:52 - Ayodele Adewale: That's why I am clarifying that I am saying the castle
13/05/2019, 17:52 - Okiki Bello: He is from Highgarden, that's what I am saying
13/05/2019, 17:52 - Okiki Bello: Highgarden is a city for crying out loud
13/05/2019, 17:53 - Ayodele Adewale: It doesn't make him Lord of High Garden
13/05/2019, 17:53 - Okiki Bello: I never said anything about Tarley being Lord of Highgarden
13/05/2019, 17:53 - Okiki Bello: BB. What's wrong?
13/05/2019, 17:53 - Ayodele Adewale: Then you've been wasting my time
13/05/2019, 17:53 - Ayodele Adewale: Because I was talking about Lords that are loyal to Dany
13/05/2019, 17:54 - Ayodele Adewale: And I mentioned HighGarden
13/05/2019, 17:54 - Ayodele Adewale: Then you disagreed stating Sam was from there
13/05/2019, 17:54 - Okiki Bello: Yes.. And i said there is no lord in highgarden again
13/05/2019, 17:54 - Ayodele Adewale: And I said his family is not in charge of High Garden
13/05/2019, 17:55 - Ayodele Adewale: It still follows my original statement
13/05/2019, 17:55 - Babayomi: <Media omitted>
13/05/2019, 17:55 - Okiki Bello: Bunk is shaking
13/05/2019, 17:55 - Ayodele Adewale: I said most of the houses that are not loyal to her except those in the North don't exactly have Lords anymore
13/05/2019, 17:55 - Okiki Bello: Okay. The last lord was Olenna
13/05/2019, 17:56 - Okiki Bello: I wasn't even talking about Lords.
13/05/2019, 17:56 - Okiki Bello: I was saying Highgarden doesn't belong to Dany
13/05/2019, 17:56 - Ayodele Adewale: Which is why I said you've been wasting my time
13/05/2019, 17:57 - Ayodele Adewale: Because I kept mentioning Lords
13/05/2019, 17:57 - Okiki Bello: No. You were the one wasting our times
13/05/2019, 17:57 - Okiki Bello: Our time*
13/05/2019, 17:57 - Ayodele Adewale: This statement is wrong
They were her allies
They got betrayed the gold was stolen but Dany destroyed the army that defeated them
13/05/2019, 17:57 - Prince: Still on this Got Talk 

Na wa oo
13/05/2019, 17:58 - Ayodele Adewale: You were just bent on proving me wrong
When I kept telling you that the Tarleys are not the Lords of High
13/05/2019, 17:58 - Ayodele Adewale: Garden
13/05/2019, 17:59 - Korede: Me sef don Taya.
13/05/2019, 17:59 - Okiki Bello: And i never said they were Lords.
13/05/2019, 17:59 - Okiki Bello: Na misunderstanding, sha. M
13/05/2019, 17:59 - Okiki Bello: We were both right in some ways.. ✌🏽
13/05/2019, 17:59 - Ayodele Adewale: That's what you implied when I said High Garden was Dany's and you mentioned Sam
13/05/2019, 17:59 - Korede: Just imagine the two of them writing their own story and script. 

Na 40 seasons go dey. 😭
13/05/2019, 18:00 - Korede: What's your problem?! Why can you bring spiritual and motivational things here.

14/05/2019, 16:24 - Korede: I've read about it.
14/05/2019, 16:24 - Korede: They should not ban them. They should leave them, give them one more chance.
14/05/2019, 16:27 - Okiki Bello: Make them ban then from buying for two seasons (four windows)
14/05/2019, 16:27 - Korede: Okay, that's okay.
14/05/2019, 16:27 - Ayodele Adewale: The investigators of the City case are mean though
14/05/2019, 16:28 - Joshua Ighalo: Anyhow they want to do it
14/05/2019, 16:28 - Korede: I don't want them banned from UCL cos they'll just focus all their strength on Epl and kill all of us again. 😭
14/05/2019, 16:28 - Ayodele Adewale: Their mates say ban for so and so transfer wimdows
14/05/2019, 16:28 - Joshua Ighalo: If we don't participate
A third successive title 😁
14/05/2019, 16:28 - Korede: Yeah. They are mean.
14/05/2019, 16:28 - Ayodele Adewale: They are saying ban from UCL
14/05/2019, 16:28 - Korede: 😒
14/05/2019, 16:29 - Joshua Ighalo: Lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
14/05/2019, 16:29 - Korede: They should just leave them abeg.
14/05/2019, 16:29 - Joshua Ighalo: You better win that final in June ooo
14/05/2019, 16:29 - Joshua Ighalo: Noooooo
Let them ban us 
We don't mind
14/05/2019, 16:29 - Prince: Y
14/05/2019, 16:30 - Korede: Don't worry about that. Me I'm not killing myself.
14/05/2019, 16:30 - Joshua Ighalo: That's my boy
14/05/2019, 16:30 - Ayodele Adewale: Financial Fair Play Issues
14/05/2019, 16:30 - Korede: Na so. Until they give you 15 point deduction in Epl too.
14/05/2019, 16:30 - Joshua Ighalo: Their Papa
14/05/2019, 16:30 - Prince: No idea what this is
14/05/2019, 16:30 - Korede: 🤦🏾‍♂ this boy has learnt bad thing sha.
14/05/2019, 16:31 - Prince: Say it slowly and dumber
14/05/2019, 16:31 - Joshua Ighalo: Hey..i senior you even though it's by months 🙄
14/05/2019, 16:31 - Korede: They are like the EFCC of football.
14/05/2019, 16:31 - Ayodele Adewale: It's a rule that's supposed to making buying and selling of players more fair for all teams
14/05/2019, 16:31 - Korede: I'll slap this one oo
14/05/2019, 16:32 - Ayodele Adewale: So that teams that have really rich owners can't have their owners bankroll them without caution
14/05/2019, 16:37 - SUG: They should do investigation sharp sharp
14/05/2019, 16:38 - Ayodele Adewale: @17786369196 you know you guys could still get a transfer ban also ba because the FA and FIFA are investigating your transfers
14/05/2019, 16:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Even if they get the ban City will appeal it
14/05/2019, 16:40 - Prince: I just de read and I no understand shut
14/05/2019, 16:40 - Prince: Shit*
14/05/2019, 16:40 - SUG: I like that Chelsea transfer ban
14/05/2019, 16:40 - Prince: 🤦🏽‍♀🤦🏽‍♀
14/05/2019, 16:40 - Ayodele Adewale: So the ban might only take effect if City lose the appeal and that might be after this coming UCL
14/05/2019, 16:41 - Kolade FUOYE: Lol
14/05/2019, 16:41 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol
This is it you can't spend more than what you can afford
14/05/2019, 16:42 - Prince: Okay
14/05/2019, 16:42 - Joshua Ighalo: Yea. But we've got a great side
14/05/2019, 16:42 - SUG: If hazard comot
They will be playing with Pedro, and giroud
14/05/2019, 16:42 - Prince: Just like diamond bank enter dept
14/05/2019, 16:42 - Ayodele Adewale: Let's say your total earning is 500mill
Your debt is 50mill
And salary and wages is 200mill
You should not spend more than 250mill
14/05/2019, 16:43 - Joshua Ighalo: Any additions to the squad now are just icing on the cake
14/05/2019, 16:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Lwkmd
This boy has never heard of something called injury crisis
14/05/2019, 16:43 - Joshua Ighalo: Just incase SUG didn't know
14/05/2019, 16:44 - Joshua Ighalo: Mendy is the definition of injury crisis bro
14/05/2019, 16:44 - Ayodele Adewale: Imagine for some strange reason you guys don't sign a back up for fernadinho
14/05/2019, 16:45 - Ayodele Adewale: Then the transfer ban hits and he get injured
14/05/2019, 16:45 - Ayodele Adewale: Do you still think any signing is just icing on the cake
14/05/2019, 16:45 - SUG: My mind just cross that part too, when BB said it

But Chelsea appeal for transfer did not work out ooo
14/05/2019, 16:45 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That guys like baily of united
14/05/2019, 16:46 - Joshua Ighalo: Gundogan can play there
14/05/2019, 16:46 - SUG: The heat will melt any of the icing
14/05/2019, 16:46 - Ayodele Adewale: Not as effective as him
Then he get shown up against bigger teams
14/05/2019, 16:47 - SUG: Like fernadinho
14/05/2019, 16:47 - SUG: I can count games that city lost without fernadinho
14/05/2019, 16:49 - SUG: Its so funny that

Liverpool lost only one game oooo, just one, and still can't win the league.....
14/05/2019, 16:49 - Ayodele Adewale: They basically have just two out and out strikers 
Aguero and Jesus
Jesus has regressed in a way
Let Aguero break leg first then you have a striker problem
14/05/2019, 16:50 - Ayodele Adewale: They bottled in real sense
They throw away a 7 point lead 
They were busy drawing games they should have won 
Now their fans are busy blaming anybody they can find but themself
14/05/2019, 16:52 - SUG: Someone said this where I watched the last game of premiership

And it look somehow

Just 1 match
14/05/2019, 16:53 - Kolade FUOYE: Liverpool lost their opportunity to win the league... No mind them.. I for say dey worst, but they won my team (barça) so I no go yab them.. 😊
14/05/2019, 16:55 - Joshua Ighalo: In pep I trust
14/05/2019, 16:55 - SUG: That man is awesome too
14/05/2019, 16:56 - Ayodele Adewale: The reasons nobody is talking about how they bottled the league are:
1. They lost only one game.
2. They had the highest point total not to win the league (pointless record)
3. They are in the Champions League Finals 
4. The manner in which they got to the finals
14/05/2019, 16:56 - Ayodele Adewale: You've turned him to a magician
14/05/2019, 16:57 - Kolade FUOYE: 👍🏻
14/05/2019, 16:57 - Joshua Ighalo: Lok
14/05/2019, 16:57 - Joshua Ighalo: Lol
14/05/2019, 16:58 - SUG: All this unnecessary draw self.......draw is just the twin brother to lose
14/05/2019, 16:59 - Ayodele Adewale: 😊
14/05/2019, 16:59 - Ayodele Adewale: Abi na
14/05/2019, 16:59 - SUG: 😒😒
14/05/2019, 17:00 - Kolade FUOYE: You're right boss boss
14/05/2019, 17:01 - Babayomi: 🤨
14/05/2019, 17:01 - SUG: Will u get out of here
14/05/2019, 17:01 - SUG: So u can't buy player next season
14/05/2019, 17:02 - Kolade FUOYE: Lol
14/05/2019, 17:02 - SUG: Giroud is ur 9
14/05/2019, 17:02 - Babayomi: Batshuayi
14/05/2019, 17:02 - Kolade FUOYE: Lol
14/05/2019, 17:02 - SUG: This true ooo
That guy is good too
14/05/2019, 17:02 - Babayomi: Even Morata. I don't want him though
14/05/2019, 17:03 - Babayomi: We still have a slim chance of getting our ban suspended though
14/05/2019, 17:04 - SUG: From what I noticed too in Chelsea

Seems the midfielders are not creative enough
14/05/2019, 17:04 - Kolade FUOYE: Guy Dem no go suspend am
14/05/2019, 17:04 - SUG: Thank God u said slim
14/05/2019, 17:04 - Babayomi: Wingers are almost zero
14/05/2019, 17:04 - SUG: Be giving yourself hope
14/05/2019, 17:04 - SUG: Morata is scoring well for ATM
14/05/2019, 17:05 - Babayomi: E no mean. We have Odoi and Pulisic 💪🏼
14/05/2019, 17:05 - SUG: And all those wing backs
14/05/2019, 17:05 - Kolade FUOYE: Even if Batshuayi returns, him no go see enough goals , same reasons that sug gave ( lack of creativity)
14/05/2019, 17:06 - Babayomi: -5
14/05/2019, 17:06 - Babayomi: True
14/05/2019, 17:06 - SUG: Thas y I credit hazard

That guy is boss
14/05/2019, 17:06 - Kolade FUOYE: Yeah na true o... Alonso go dey play 3 with 11...
14/05/2019, 17:06 - SUG: U get my point
14/05/2019, 17:08 - Okiki Bello: It's always 5. Not 15
14/05/2019, 17:08 - Babayomi: Don't worry sha. I don't have high hopes for us next season esp if they don't suspend the ban. Let's say 4th place finish and champions league trophy will do 🙂
14/05/2019, 17:08 - Babayomi: FIFA 🙌🏽
14/05/2019, 17:08 - Kolade FUOYE: U sef u know urself na???
Make I no talk further... 🤦🏼‍♂

14/05/2019, 17:10 - Ayodele Adewale: Laughs in Juve
14/05/2019, 17:10 - Prince: Getting more complicated
14/05/2019, 17:10 - Babayomi: Naa. Man City's name has been permanently written on it
14/05/2019, 17:11 - Okiki Bello: Why's the man laughing báyìí?
14/05/2019, 17:11 - Kolade FUOYE: Ok it means no Goldberg for u na... 😅
14/05/2019, 17:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Ever heard of the Italian match fixing scandal a couple of years ago
14/05/2019, 17:11 - SUG: They should winning it
14/05/2019, 17:12 - Okiki Bello: Yeah.. Kind of!
14/05/2019, 17:12 - Okiki Bello: They got a 15points deduction rule?
14/05/2019, 17:13 - Ayodele Adewale: I am a lil certain more than 5 points was deducted
14/05/2019, 17:13 - Ayodele Adewale: They got relegated to seria B
14/05/2019, 17:17 - Okiki Bello: That one is match fixing na.
14/05/2019, 17:18 - Okiki Bello: That FFP rule na bastard. It made me leave Arsenal at FM2018
14/05/2019, 17:18 - Ayodele Adewale: It's like you think financial fair play rules are a joke
14/05/2019, 17:18 - Okiki Bello: They i couldn't get a job, attended four interviews (Man city, Roma, Inter and one other club) why? Because i failed FFP at Arsenal.
14/05/2019, 17:19 - Ayodele Adewale: And that's just a game oh
14/05/2019, 17:20 - Okiki Bello: Lol.. Barca and Real Madrid started bidding for my players. Top players. Those ones started requesting to leave because there was no champions league football and i get transfer ban join.
14/05/2019, 17:21 - Okiki Bello: If it's one season. It's better fah! Two seasons would be worst!
14/05/2019, 17:22 - Ayodele Adewale: Lwkmd
14/05/2019, 17:22 - Ayodele Adewale: They did you strong thing fa
14/05/2019, 17:24 - Okiki Bello: I swear, morale went low.. I went a season only losing a match. I started the season by losing to a newly promoted club then, after October internationals, i was in 10 or 11th. I just resigned jejely!
14/05/2019, 17:24 - Okiki Bello: Since then, i have mastered the FFP rule
14/05/2019, 17:25 - Ayodele Adewale: I would love to play the new fm
14/05/2019, 17:25 - Ayodele Adewale: Seems more challenging
14/05/2019, 17:26 - Ayodele Adewale: You lost only one by restarting ba
14/05/2019, 17:31 - Okiki Bello: Very cool. Cool graphics
14/05/2019, 17:36 - Okiki Bello: It's 2gb. Torrent compressed file
14/05/2019, 17:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Aii
14/05/2019, 17:48 - Okiki Bello: You can't talk to any player anyhow. There are dynamics
14/05/2019, 17:49 - Okiki Bello: Team leaders to Highly influential to Influential players to other players..
14/05/2019, 17:49 - Okiki Bello: Those Highly influential and Team leaders have problems! Don't talk trash about them in press or private chat... You have lost the whole team.
14/05/2019, 17:51 - Okiki Bello: I started in real Madrid and sold Casilla, baba was a team leader. Sergio Ramos(another team leader) got pissed, Marcelo (team leader) followed. Then the whole team morale started dropping.
14/05/2019, 17:53 - Ayodele Adewale: Then you got sacked
14/05/2019, 17:58 - Okiki Bello: No.. A series of bad form followed. Bad results. I just deleted the game jejely and started with Arsenal
14/05/2019, 18:18 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol
You no just get mind
14/05/2019, 18:26 - Okiki Bello: Funny part was i won the EPL and Europa with Arsenal
14/05/2019, 18:29 - Babayomi: I'd really like to play it
14/05/2019, 18:32 - Ayodele Adewale: Congratulations
14/05/2019, 18:37 - Okiki Bello: You would like it
14/05/2019, 18:37 - Okiki Bello: Football Manager 19
14/05/2019, 18:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Aii
14/05/2019, 18:40 - Korede: Bolton got 12.
14/05/2019, 18:40 - Okiki Bello: FFP?
14/05/2019, 18:42 - Korede: FA
14/05/2019, 18:43 - Korede: And according to what I read, it could still increase.
14/05/2019, 18:44 - Okiki Bello: What did Bolton do?
14/05/2019, 18:45 - Korede: Let me check
14/05/2019, 18:45 - Korede: But it doesn't involve Financial fair play.
14/05/2019, 18:45 - Korede: My point is that, it can be more than 5.
14/05/2019, 18:47 - Ayodele Adewale: As I said earlier
14/05/2019, 18:47 - Ayodele Adewale: Bolton is going into administration
14/05/2019, 18:49 - Okiki Bello: My point us FFP gives 5points.
14/05/2019, 18:49 - Okiki Bello: My point is*
14/05/2019, 18:50 - Korede: 🤷🏾‍♂
14/05/2019, 19:05 - Korede: I hope Mancity gets 55
14/05/2019, 19:44 - Prince: <Media omitted>
14/05/2019, 19:46 - Timi: Why asking BB???

15/05/2019, 00:11 - SUG: Barcelona is the potential team to buy him

That is the feeling
15/05/2019, 00:12 - Eniola: They will not still win champions league

Please people deserve better
15/05/2019, 05:43 - Ayodele Adewale: He wants to leave according to the papers but his agent is banned till a day after the transfer window meaning it's going to be difficult for him to leave (if it's true) till January
16/05/2019, 14:10 - Okiki Bello: Does he really need a agent?
16/05/2019, 14:11 - Ayodele Adewale: That's the idea

20/05/2019, 11:30 - Ayodele Adewale: You saw the scripts ogbeni
20/05/2019, 11:31 - Ayodele Adewale: And this confirms you are not well
20/05/2019, 11:31 - Ayodele Adewale: Because Timi saw the whole thing and didn't say a word
20/05/2019, 11:31 - Ayodele Adewale: But in your case you will go and look for spoilers
20/05/2019, 11:32 - Ayodele Adewale: Then come and paste it in the group claiming you didn't know it was authentic
20/05/2019, 11:59 - Babayomi: Lol
20/05/2019, 12:00 - Babayomi: Okiki sha
20/05/2019, 12:01 - Ayodele Adewale: Don't mind him
20/05/2019, 12:02 - Ayodele Adewale: Truth is he can't come and claim he guessed
20/05/2019, 12:13 - Okiki Bello: BB always think someone can't guess right!
20/05/2019, 12:13 - Okiki Bello: I didn't look for spoilers. Who looks for spoilers?
20/05/2019, 12:14 - Prince: He is d real imp

Ayodele lannister
20/05/2019, 12:15 - Prince: The hand of the kind, the only son of his father, first of his father and the real and one through BB
20/05/2019, 12:17 - Okiki Bello: Lmao
20/05/2019, 12:18 - Okiki Bello: I have a feeling, Jon is going to be ruling the free folks!
20/05/2019, 12:19 - Prince: Stop feeling the movies is finished....no episode 7 or season 9
20/05/2019, 12:30 - Ayodele Adewale: You
20/05/2019, 12:30 - Ayodele Adewale: We all know you didn't guess right
20/05/2019, 12:34 - Ayodele Adewale: I am willing to let you have guessing Jon will Dany
But every other thing you got from spoilers
20/05/2019, 13:45 - Oye: True
20/05/2019, 13:45 - Oye: Okiki the Spoiler!
20/05/2019, 13:46 - Oye: Always unable to keep his mouth shut
20/05/2019, 13:46 - Ayodele Adewale: He is even lucky I completely forgot he dropped those messages
20/05/2019, 13:47 - Ayodele Adewale: It's not that he us unable to it's just that he is unwillingly to
20/05/2019, 13:48 - Oye: True... But this is the second time!
20/05/2019, 13:48 - Ayodele Adewale: Hence why I said he is not well
20/05/2019, 13:48 - Oye: It means he doesn't learn
20/05/2019, 13:49 - Oye: He might have a learning disability
20/05/2019, 13:49 - Ayodele Adewale: This is least insulting I can be on this issue to him
20/05/2019, 13:49 - Ayodele Adewale: As in eh
20/05/2019, 13:50 - Ayodele Adewale: This more is more annoying because @2348166951056 saw the scripts of each episode
20/05/2019, 13:50 - Ayodele Adewale: And he didn't spoil a single thing
20/05/2019, 13:50 - Ayodele Adewale: But not Okiki
20/05/2019, 13:51 - Ayodele Adewale: Maybe whenever highly anticipated shows or movies are almost out we will start kicking him out of the group for a couple of weeks
20/05/2019, 13:51 - Ayodele Adewale: Maybe then he will learn
20/05/2019, 13:52 - Oye: That might be the best
20/05/2019, 13:53 - Ayodele Adewale: Yep
20/05/2019, 13:53 - Ayodele Adewale: Anyways I like the ending
20/05/2019, 13:54 - Oye: I accepted it but didn't feel it was interesting enough experience for such a good show
20/05/2019, 13:55 - Ayodele Adewale: I actually liked the episode
20/05/2019, 13:56 - Ayodele Adewale: To create that experience as far as I am concerned might have meant another war
20/05/2019, 13:59 - Oye: Lol... Probably right, but they were able to do it after the battle of the bastards in season 6
20/05/2019, 14:00 - Oye: With cersie destroying the keep
20/05/2019, 14:00 - Oye: With all her enemies
20/05/2019, 14:11 - Ayodele Adewale: For one
20/05/2019, 14:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Cersie's enemies were all in one place
20/05/2019, 14:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Her enemies didn't have a Dragon
20/05/2019, 14:12 - Ayodele Adewale: Plus the whole of Kings Landing was in ruins
20/05/2019, 14:12 - Ayodele Adewale: Then you can't kill someone who has an extremely high tolerance of fire with fire
20/05/2019, 14:14 - Ayodele Adewale: If for any reason Dany wasn't killed at Kings Landing then she would have been almost impossible to kill
20/05/2019, 14:22 - Oye: I understand that the show producers had no other option! I think it is a good ending, but I didn't get to feel the "wow" factor that I have come to expect from GoT
20/05/2019, 14:36 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol
Aii
I just feel there wasn't a need for any serious fanfare in the episode
20/05/2019, 16:30 - Korede: All hail Bran the Broken
First of his name, 
King of the Andals and of the first Men, 
Ruler of the six kingdoms and Protector of the realm. 
Brandon Stark
20/05/2019, 16:31 - Eniola: Sha GOT don end

20/05/2019, 20:42 - Okiki Bello: What's funny there? Something you are not watching!
20/05/2019, 20:43 - Eniola: 🙄🙄🙄
20/05/2019, 20:47 - Korede: So my uncle and his bride to be did their pre-wedding shoot wearing Liverpool jerseys. I know they are saying they will never walk alone 

But... I keep praying and hoping they don't end up bottling it. 😪
20/05/2019, 20:47 - Okiki Bello: 🙄🤣🤣🤣

20/05/2019, 21:56 - Prince: The movies was all about the starks Las Las
20/05/2019, 22:03 - Korede: They tried. They lost a lot too. 
Father

Two siblings
How many dire wolves??

20/05/2019, 22:04 - Ayodele Adewale: Come up with a better ending
20/05/2019, 22:05 - Prince: Continue de find watin no lost o
20/05/2019, 22:06 - Ayodele Adewale: You are the one looking for something that's missing
20/05/2019, 22:06 - Ayodele Adewale: You keep saying they won
20/05/2019, 22:06 - Ayodele Adewale: Technically they just survived
20/05/2019, 22:07 - Ayodele Adewale: They had to agree to the life banishment of their eldest surviving sibling
20/05/2019, 22:07 - Ayodele Adewale: Arya is no longer in Westoros
20/05/2019, 22:08 - Korede: Bran can't give birth.
20/05/2019, 22:08 - Ayodele Adewale: Plus the Starks had the highest number of children
20/05/2019, 22:09 - Ayodele Adewale: In the end even if you do probability they had a higher chance of winning
20/05/2019, 22:09 - Ayodele Adewale: Meaning a Stark is not going to be the next king
20/05/2019, 22:09 - Ayodele Adewale: Sansa might not get married
20/05/2019, 22:10 - Ayodele Adewale: So there is no guarantee that the North will still be under Stark control
20/05/2019, 22:12 - Korede: 🤷🏾‍♂
20/05/2019, 22:13 - Prince: Durh 

We know he is a tygarian
20/05/2019, 22:14 - Prince: She won in her own way 

Killing the night king...a small girl killing the boss and those minions watched her kill their king
20/05/2019, 22:15 - Prince: Can ayefele give birth 🤦🏽‍♀
20/05/2019, 22:15 - Prince: I trust you 

Ayodele lannister
20/05/2019, 22:16 - Prince: Film don finish na🤕
20/05/2019, 22:22 - Ayodele Adewale: But grew up a Stark 
And his mum is a Stark
20/05/2019, 22:22 - Ayodele Adewale: She was trained to be stealthy remember
20/05/2019, 22:24 - Prince: Does not change his surname, last of his name, killed my several stabbing and came back to save the realm, bla bla bla
20/05/2019, 22:24 - Prince: So she would beat all of those minions if they actually fought with her
20/05/2019, 22:25 - Ayodele Adewale: You do know the meaning of stealthy ba
20/05/2019, 22:25 - Ayodele Adewale: I didn't change his name
20/05/2019, 22:26 - Prince: No matter how 

It wont be that easy 

Why did she run from the zombies in the house and why did the lord of light die for her
20/05/2019, 22:27 - Ayodele Adewale: Virtually everybody still referred to him as Jon Snow
And the girls and Bran still called him brother
20/05/2019, 22:29 - Ayodele Adewale: Baba stealthy doesn't mean indestructible na
If you remember the episode well she was able to sneak past them effectively till they were in the hallway when the space was too tight to do that
That's why he gave his life to save them
20/05/2019, 22:42 - Prince: Exactly...it was not easy
20/05/2019, 22:42 - Prince: But killing the king was like eating bread and beans
20/05/2019, 22:44 - Ayodele Adewale: She had the quality to make it look simple
20/05/2019, 22:44 - Ayodele Adewale: She had the training for crying out loud
21/05/2019, 07:15 - Okiki Bello: Yes.. It didn't affect his thing!

06/08/2019, 20:17 - Joshua Ighalo: Missing out on UCL at  a club not even sure of UCL the following season

Why not just chip the money 🤷🏾‍♂
06/08/2019, 20:18 - Ayodele Adewale: He wanted to be one of the highest paid in the league
06/08/2019, 20:18 - SUG: They money should motive

06/08/2019, 20:19 - Ayodele Adewale: Toh
06/08/2019, 20:20 - Ayodele Adewale: United has learnt not to sign star players that only signed because of the huge wages they were going to get
06/08/2019, 20:21 - SUG: Sanchez

That stuff kill PSG
06/08/2019, 20:21 - Ayodele Adewale: Then there's Di Maria 
Falcao
06/08/2019, 20:22 - Ayodele Adewale: Well Hotspur have UCL let's see if he will not have huge demands for them because of that
06/08/2019, 20:23 - Ayodele Adewale: Because I know Spurs will not offer to pay him as much as United did
06/08/2019, 20:23 - SUG: I was about saying that

If we did want to compete with you guys, we would have gotten him 


But his wages were outrageous for his "talent" 



We did good business
06/08/2019, 20:28 - Ayodele Adewale: You do know United is richer than City ba
06/08/2019, 20:30 - Korede: Yep

06/08/2019, 20:33 - Ayodele Adewale: Assuming they agree personal terms with him
06/08/2019, 20:33 - Ayodele Adewale: Smh

06/08/2019, 20:36 - Ayodele Adewale: Because of the high wage demands and agent fees
06/08/2019, 20:37 - Korede: That Dybala boy sef
06/08/2019, 20:39 - SUG: How can he demand highest paid in league

Salah and all those Manchester city player should do what

07/08/2019, 21:45 - Korede: *🚨 BREAKING: New Samsung Galaxy Note 📱 Has Two Sizes, New S Pen and Dex on Your Laptop; It Will Be Available on Aug 23 Starting at $949*

Samsung announced on Wednesday not one, but two versions of its flagship Galaxy Note 10 smartphone: the regular Note 10 and the jumbo Note 10 Plus.

You should think of the Note 10 Plus as the traditional Note — it’s virtually the same size as last year’s Note 9 and continues the tradition of the big-screened, super-powered, stylus-toting smartphone. The Note 10 is something new: the Note’s stylus and power crammed down into something a little closer to the size of the Galaxy S10.

The Note 10 starts at $949 and comes in just one configuration: 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The Note 10 Plus starts at $1,099 with 12GB RAM / 256GB storage and you can spend $100 more to get 512GB of storage.

Both are available for preorder on Wednesday and will ship on August 23rd. There will also be a Note 10 5G available for preorder on the 23rd that will be exclusive to Verizon for “a limited time,” but Samsung had fewer details to share about it ahead of its Unpacked event today.

There is no headphone jack on the Note 10 — Samsung says it used the extra space for more battery. Samsung is including USB-C headphones in the box, but not the dongle, which costs $9.99.

08/08/2019, 18:14 - Ayodele Adewale: At the end of the day Arsenal had a better transfer window that Manchester United
08/08/2019, 18:15 - Okiki Bello: And sold Iwobi, I am sad
08/08/2019, 18:17 - Ayodele Adewale: You are not serious
08/08/2019, 18:18 - Okiki Bello: I still rate Iwobi over Mhkirtaryan. I am serious.
08/08/2019, 18:19 - SUG: Abegi
No difference babami
08/08/2019, 18:19 - SUG: In fact they are playing miki out of wing more
08/08/2019, 18:19 - Okiki Bello: Iwobi is still better than Mhkirtaryan..
08/08/2019, 18:19 - Okiki Bello: You should know this!
08/08/2019, 18:20 - SUG: See ehn 
No difference

Iwobi had two goals last season

Miki created chances and did not even score more that two also
08/08/2019, 18:20 - SUG: They are the same
08/08/2019, 18:21 - Okiki Bello: Iwobi created more chances than Mhkirtaryan
08/08/2019, 18:21 - SUG: Meanwhile
Miki is a natural 10, and he plays out of position
08/08/2019, 18:21 - SUG: Maybe
08/08/2019, 18:21 - Okiki Bello: Iwobi is a dribbler and a creative player. Young and an homegrown player
08/08/2019, 18:22 - Okiki Bello: Iwobi can play on the wings and in the middle.
08/08/2019, 18:22 - Ayodele Adewale: You are just being sentimental jare Okiki
08/08/2019, 18:22 - SUG: Is only the young I see

Iwobi can't shoot, is not really fast, see ehn the are the same
08/08/2019, 18:22 - SUG: Am telling u
08/08/2019, 18:22 - Okiki Bello: Iwobi can still improve
08/08/2019, 18:22 - Okiki Bello: How??
08/08/2019, 18:23 - Okiki Bello: Iwobi would perform better in Everton!
08/08/2019, 18:24 - SUG: The last time miki played 10, he had three assist 

Two goal came from auba 

Go and check this
But if ozil don play like this, baba go move go seven
08/08/2019, 18:24 - SUG: He should go and do that
08/08/2019, 18:24 - Okiki Bello: Lol.. When? Last season?
08/08/2019, 18:25 - Okiki Bello: And you think he would play 10 this season.
08/08/2019, 18:25 - Okiki Bello: See.. Let's relax and watch. I still don't rate Arsenal with this transfers..
08/08/2019, 18:25 - SUG: That is just the problem

19/08/2019, 22:27 - Korede: Shebi I said Wolves can't beat Manu like before.
19/08/2019, 22:27 - Korede: Felt.
19/08/2019, 22:33 - SUG: You said like rag
19/08/2019, 22:33 - Korede: It was a metaphor.
19/08/2019, 22:33 - Korede: Or whatever they call it.
19/08/2019, 22:34 - SUG: Metaphor kee you there
19/08/2019, 22:34 - SUG: 🤣🤣
19/08/2019, 22:35 - Korede: <Media omitted>
19/08/2019, 22:46 - Okiki Bello: Pele oo. Alagba player analyst.

19/08/2019, 22:48 - SUG: Ahhh

20/08/2019, 08:39 - Okiki Bello: Lmao.. Korede, fe ma whine me.
20/08/2019, 08:40 - Oluwatobi K: Leave him... They will be shocked. 🌚
20/08/2019, 08:40 - Ayodele Adewale: I'll just be observing
20/08/2019, 08:40 - Okiki Bello: We know it's a L, we just hoping the score doesn't reach the same the last time.
20/08/2019, 08:41 - Korede: 🙃
20/08/2019, 08:41 - Korede: At all.
20/08/2019, 08:41 - Korede: Relax.
20/08/2019, 08:41 - Oluwatobi K: I don't know it's L o, this is football...

Yea we have a very slim chance at anfield, but I'm not writing Arsenal off...
20/08/2019, 08:42 - Korede: Look Arsenal is a tough side. They've been playing really well this start of the season.
20/08/2019, 08:42 - Korede: Will do.
20/08/2019, 08:42 - Okiki Bello: ANFIELD!
20/08/2019, 08:42 - Korede: One thing I'm almost certain of is this. Arsenal won't win at ANFIELD.
20/08/2019, 08:42 - Okiki Bello: Something is doing you, Korede..
20/08/2019, 08:43 - Korede: Na only Manu dey try that nonsense.
20/08/2019, 08:43 - Korede: 😂
20/08/2019, 08:43 - Okiki Bello: Even BARCELONA couldn't do a thing at Anfield.
20/08/2019, 08:43 - Korede: I'm serious joor.
20/08/2019, 08:43 - Okiki Bello: The highest Arsenal can do is a draw. That's if they are lucky!
20/08/2019, 08:44 - Okiki Bello: You are not. Until you start calling a spade a spade
20/08/2019, 08:44 - Korede: Ceballos had two assists in the last game. TWO!
Auba is on fleek. Lacazette is blazing. I mean come on...
20/08/2019, 08:44 - Oluwatobi K: It's a football field sir..😅
20/08/2019, 08:44 - Okiki Bello: <Media omitted>
20/08/2019, 08:45 - Okiki Bello: Korede!!!! Be warned plsl
20/08/2019, 08:45 - Oluwatobi K: Continue o... Peter Dury.🌝
20/08/2019, 08:45 - Korede: Alisson is Injured. We haven't kept a clean sheet. We are not in rhythm. Arsenal has the upper hand here.
20/08/2019, 08:45 - Okiki Bello: <Media omitted>
20/08/2019, 08:45 - Korede: Please don't insult ANFIELD abeg.
20/08/2019, 08:45 - Korede: I'm sorry.
20/08/2019, 08:45 - Korede: Thank you jaare.
20/08/2019, 08:45 - Okiki Bello: Mane is not injured, not even Salah.. Firmino is another important personality
20/08/2019, 08:46 - Oluwatobi K: Be giving us tips...

That stupid firminho will start dribbling my defenders 😭
20/08/2019, 08:46 - Okiki Bello: You see!!! Korede knows what he is doing
20/08/2019, 08:46 - Korede: But seriously, the game will be enjoyable.
20/08/2019, 08:46 - Korede: 🌝
20/08/2019, 08:46 - Okiki Bello: No.. Would be dribbling Mustafi
20/08/2019, 08:46 - Korede: I remember Torriera. 🤣🤣🤣
20/08/2019, 08:46 - Oluwatobi K: I fear that firminho than the remaining two... Joke apart
20/08/2019, 08:47 - Oluwatobi K: 🤣🤣🤣
20/08/2019, 08:47 - Okiki Bello: Yes. Because one side would make it more interesting and i am sure it's not Arsenal
20/08/2019, 08:47 - Korede: No na. Anfield isn't just a football field na. Which kind insult be that. That's out Home.
20/08/2019, 08:47 - Korede: *our
20/08/2019, 08:47 - Korede: The guy likes Arsenal ehn.
20/08/2019, 08:48 - Okiki Bello: Is it Maitland niles that would defend against Firmino or Mane
20/08/2019, 08:48 - Korede: The two actually. The two. 

Arsenal attack is fun to watch. We almost always concede against you guys. And of you get 2 goals first, we've definitely lost.
20/08/2019, 08:48 - Okiki Bello: Right now, any wolf that enters Anfield becomes a chicken..
20/08/2019, 08:49 - Okiki Bello: Arsenal is not even a wolf
20/08/2019, 08:49 - Korede: 😂 

Is it na Van Dijk that will stop Aubameyang?! 😒
20/08/2019, 08:49 - Oluwatobi K: 😭😭😭
20/08/2019, 08:49 - Okiki Bello: Like as if, he didn't stop him the last time
20/08/2019, 08:49 - Korede: Even Barca that were lions sef. 🤣
20/08/2019, 08:50 - Oluwatobi K: PepeIsHere😎
20/08/2019, 08:50 - Okiki Bello: He just always scores against Arsenal
20/08/2019, 08:50 - Korede: But my front three against Arsenal are always a joy to watch. 

But I just want to enjoy the game. 

I have no expectations... Yet.
20/08/2019, 08:50 - Okiki Bello: If it's Emirate Stadium, i would be gunning for a draw or hopefully (10%) a win. But Anfield.. Lose.. 5% chances of draw
20/08/2019, 08:51 - Okiki Bello: <Media omitted>

20/08/2019, 08:52 - Korede: And I'm supporting us.
20/08/2019, 08:53 - Oluwatobi K: You people better don't joke with Pepe... He can be dangerous o.


I see him scoring his debut goal against Liverpool..
20/08/2019, 08:55 - Korede: I'm not joking about him. 

Who tok sat hin no go score?!

20/08/2019, 09:06 - Korede: I just want an EPL in my life. Is that too much to ask?! 😭😭😭
20/08/2019, 09:07 - Ayodele Adewale: Because??
20/08/2019, 09:07 - Korede: He's the only one with enough or the right Arsenal to assault me.
20/08/2019, 09:07 - Korede: We are friends. And you love me too much to want to hurt me.
20/08/2019, 09:08 - Ayodele Adewale: Lwkmd
20/08/2019, 09:08 - Ayodele Adewale: We shall see
20/08/2019, 09:08 - Ayodele Adewale: Depends on my mood
20/08/2019, 09:08 - Korede: He is laughing. 🤣
20/08/2019, 09:08 - Korede: Evil being.
20/08/2019, 09:09 - Oluwatobi K: Story... 🌚
20/08/2019, 09:09 - Korede: Hopefully she would have said yes. Alert go don enter and etcetera.
20/08/2019, 09:09 - Korede: I would have said you should beg too but you guys are already used to it.
20/08/2019, 09:10 - Ayodele Adewale: 😇
20/08/2019, 09:10 - Ayodele Adewale: Lwkmd
Lemme rephrase depends on how United's game goes

20/08/2019, 09:12 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
20/08/2019, 09:13 - Ayodele Adewale: I am sure you are thinking if we don't win then I won't banter
20/08/2019, 09:14 - Ayodele Adewale: Think again my friends
20/08/2019, 09:14 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

21/08/2019, 17:12 - Oluwatobi K: Ooops..

21/08/2019, 22:15 - Oluwatobi K: Maybe
23/08/2019, 12:26 - Korede: Should I sell Salah and bring in Debruyne or Mane?!
23/08/2019, 13:00 - SUG: Do that quick
23/08/2019, 13:03 - Korede: De bruyne or Mane?
23/08/2019, 13:05 - SUG: De bruyne
23/08/2019, 13:08 - Oluwatobi K: It's a very difficult choice ....

Debruyne all the way tho.
23/08/2019, 13:20 - Eniola: Man city that can bench anyhow
Na only their keeper be sure starter
23/08/2019, 13:21 - Orisa: Not de bruyne
23/08/2019, 13:22 - Eniola: Okay
23/08/2019, 14:23 - Oluwatobi K: Debruyne ???... 

Expect he's injured...
24/08/2019, 12:38 - SUG: U getter go and buy pukki
24/08/2019, 12:38 - SUG: To complement your strikers
24/08/2019, 12:38 - ASUG's security code changed. Tap for more info.
24/08/2019, 12:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Network made not bring him in for this game week
24/08/2019, 12:41 - SUG: I love the fact that is not expensive
24/08/2019, 12:41 - Ayodele Adewale: See you
24/08/2019, 12:42 - Ayodele Adewale: They will gradually increase his price
24/08/2019, 12:42 - Ayodele Adewale: In fact lemme go and do the transfer before the end of this game week
24/08/2019, 12:48 - SUG: I tell you
24/08/2019, 13:01 - Eniola: Everywhere goals

24/08/2019, 13:53 - Kolade FUOYE: The guy dey on point
24/08/2019, 13:57 - Eniola: 3-2
24/08/2019, 14:16 - Kolade FUOYE: Who scored?
24/08/2019, 14:17 - Eniola: Abraham
24/08/2019, 14:18 - Kolade FUOYE: Chai and I sold the guy oo
24/08/2019, 14:23 - Okiki Bello: I haven't had time for my team sef.
24/08/2019, 14:30 - Eniola: Lol 😂
It happens like that
24/08/2019, 14:47 - Kolade FUOYE: Nawa o. Lol
24/08/2019, 15:49 - Joshua Ighalo: I can't be the only one seeing Zaha murder Young
24/08/2019, 15:49 - SUG: I can't even understand again
24/08/2019, 15:50 - Ayodele Adewale: That young is still a defensive option for us is a disgrace
24/08/2019, 15:51 - Eniola: Zaha and young was the highlight of the first half
24/08/2019, 15:51 - Eniola: Baba just go sell himself anyhow
24/08/2019, 15:52 - Joshua Ighalo: Honestly 
United should go and get a legit coach. There are lots of them out there in the market
24/08/2019, 15:53 - Okiki Bello: Legit coach?
24/08/2019, 15:53 - Okiki Bello: You once forgot your coach was just like this "illegit coach" too
24/08/2019, 15:54 - Joshua Ighalo: Which one please? Because my last 3 coaches are  better than ole and all won the PL
24/08/2019, 15:55 - Joshua Ighalo: In comparison to your last 3
24/08/2019, 15:55 - Okiki Bello: Your recent coach started like Ole, too!
24/08/2019, 15:55 - Joshua Ighalo: Mtcheeew
24/08/2019, 15:56 - Okiki Bello: Your coach, rather
24/08/2019, 15:56 - Ayodele Adewale: Joshua he is not talking about Pep's current level
24/08/2019, 15:56 - Okiki Bello: You just need to calm down with guy. He is just starting!
24/08/2019, 15:57 - Joshua Ighalo: Ole has played in the PL for years
Knows the system 

Pep never played in the PL, had to understand the system.
24/08/2019, 15:57 - Joshua Ighalo: I don't need to explain this to you guys
24/08/2019, 15:57 - Joshua Ighalo: Anyway, all am saying is Ole isn't the answer to United's problem
24/08/2019, 15:57 - Okiki Bello: Lmao... He had the fucking money!
24/08/2019, 15:57 - SUG: 👍🏼👍🏼
24/08/2019, 15:57 - Ayodele Adewale: Joshua 
Pep didn't start out being a good coach
24/08/2019, 15:57 - Joshua Ighalo: I wished you guys could get Poch
24/08/2019, 15:58 - Okiki Bello: This is my point!
24/08/2019, 15:58 - Ayodele Adewale: He started from Barcelona B
24/08/2019, 15:58 - Okiki Bello: Thank you!
24/08/2019, 15:58 - Joshua Ighalo: Then use it as your point next time bro
24/08/2019, 15:58 - Ayodele Adewale: He learnt and perfected his trade there
24/08/2019, 15:58 - Okiki Bello: You didn't read well
24/08/2019, 15:58 - Ayodele Adewale: Yeah he misunderstood you
24/08/2019, 15:58 - Joshua Ighalo: Please let's hear word
Is it rocks they gave to OLE
24/08/2019, 15:59 - Joshua Ighalo: You didn't type well
24/08/2019, 15:59 - Okiki Bello: And he wasn't taking a team that's not good again
24/08/2019, 15:59 - Joshua Ighalo: Anyway, I gave my opinion 
Am entitled to it
24/08/2019, 15:59 - Eniola: So playing is same as coaching?
If I send thunder ⚡ to you in Canada ehhh 🙄
24/08/2019, 15:59 - Okiki Bello: He had a good team when he took over
24/08/2019, 15:59 - Joshua Ighalo: Think before you type and get what I meant from that statement
24/08/2019, 16:00 - Okiki Bello: If pep took over a club like Leicester, he wouldn't achieve shit!
24/08/2019, 16:00 - Joshua Ighalo: ☝🏾
24/08/2019, 16:00 - Eniola: You wanna compare 90's to this present age
24/08/2019, 16:00 - Okiki Bello: Are you minding him?
24/08/2019, 16:00 - Joshua Ighalo: English football hasn't really evolved,  has it?
24/08/2019, 16:00 - Eniola: Explain what you mean?
24/08/2019, 16:00 - Ayodele Adewale: Eni you are actually right playing is different from coaching
24/08/2019, 16:01 - Okiki Bello: Let's even agree he spent a year adapting to the premier league
24/08/2019, 16:01 - Ayodele Adewale: There are a lot of exceptional players that are terrible coaches 
E.g. Maradona
24/08/2019, 16:01 - Joshua Ighalo: Yes it is but you know what I mean 

Ole has always had an idea of the game 


Pep had basically no idea
24/08/2019, 16:01 - Eniola: Things change, you can't compare then to now. I don't know how I will explain it for you. But the changes are much
24/08/2019, 16:02 - Eniola: Explain what he means?
24/08/2019, 16:02 - Okiki Bello: The coach i respect most in the Premier league is Klopp. Man took time to build his team
24/08/2019, 16:02 - Joshua Ighalo: Am not saying Ole is terrible 
United need a quick fix and not a long term solution
24/08/2019, 16:02 - Okiki Bello: I don't even understand him
24/08/2019, 16:02 - Ayodele Adewale: You know the premier league has evolved since Ole last played it
24/08/2019, 16:02 - Okiki Bello: Rebuilding that team would take long!
24/08/2019, 16:02 - Eniola: 🤣 🤣 🤣
24/08/2019, 16:02 - Okiki Bello: We even discussed it here. That it should take three to five transfer windows
24/08/2019, 16:03 - Ayodele Adewale: Mourinho was a quick fix
Look how that turned out
24/08/2019, 16:03 - Joshua Ighalo: C'mon Wale 

We both know it hasn't na

Majority of the teams still play the physical long ball games apart from the top 6 (playing different styles)
24/08/2019, 16:04 - Joshua Ighalo: I no get strength argue
24/08/2019, 16:04 - Joshua Ighalo: Like I said earlier
24/08/2019, 16:04 - Joshua Ighalo: ☝🏾
24/08/2019, 16:04 - Okiki Bello: Ighalo. Calm down.
24/08/2019, 16:05 - Ayodele Adewale: United was never a long ball team
24/08/2019, 16:05 - Eniola: Second half don start
Everybody bye bye 👋
24/08/2019, 16:05 - Joshua Ighalo: I said apart from the top 6
24/08/2019, 16:05 - Okiki Bello: Manchester united needs rebuilding. Some players need to leave the club and some players need to get in to fit into Ole plan.

Pep didn't play tiki taka in most of his games In his first season
24/08/2019, 16:06 - Okiki Bello: Because the players can't adapt quickly. Rebuilding Manchester united would take time. Not a quick fix.
24/08/2019, 16:06 - Ayodele Adewale: My own point is you can't say Ole is supposed to succeed as a coach at United because he has played in the premier league
24/08/2019, 16:12 - Joshua Ighalo: Motigbo!!!!
24/08/2019, 16:31 - SUG: Rashford miss penalty

24/08/2019, 17:05 - Joshua Ighalo: Is Emery scared
24/08/2019, 17:05 - Joshua Ighalo: Arsenal's starting lineup is very predictable 
Play Pepe and Auba on the wing with Laca in the middle and Ceballos in behind the three
24/08/2019, 17:05 - Jb Rama: He knows what he is doing
24/08/2019, 17:06 - SUG: Not yet fit for match

24/08/2019, 19:15 - SUG: His problem was *defending*
24/08/2019, 19:17 - Okiki Bello: Ola... Trent and Robertson wouldn't be overlapping like they were in the seventy minutes so far if started Lacazette, Auba and Pepe
24/08/2019, 19:17 - Okiki Bello: They know they would be leaving a mad trio of attacks behind
24/08/2019, 19:18 - Okiki Bello: His problem is not defending.. We know Arsenal defense is nonsense... But our coach is freaking mad.. His thinking is absurd
24/08/2019, 19:18 - SUG: I believe if lacazette was there in first half, they will still defend
24/08/2019, 19:18 - Okiki Bello: Who??
24/08/2019, 19:18 - SUG: Arsenal as a whole
24/08/2019, 19:18 - SUG: Just check the first half
24/08/2019, 19:18 - Okiki Bello: Ola.. You still don't understand

Arsenal were just being Arsenal. It was fantasy on anyone's part to think they'd win at ANFIELD.
24/08/2019, 19:35 - Kolade FUOYE: <Media omitted>

Was anything wrong with what she said. Although she said something to the extreme. But it's what most women do. They would just get annoyed unnecessary for you to start begging.
25/08/2019, 14:21 - Eniola: It is wrong boss mi
25/08/2019, 14:22 - Eniola: How Wil you just wake up one morning and say you want to provoke your husband
25/08/2019, 14:22 - Eniola: No mood swing, nothing at all. But you just want quarrel
25/08/2019, 14:22 - Eniola: Are you a witch? 🤷🏽‍♂
25/08/2019, 14:23 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣
25/08/2019, 14:23 - SUG: You better leave toke alone
25/08/2019, 14:24 - SUG: You should not even seek for our opinion on this 🤣🤣

That lady is another thing
25/08/2019, 14:25 - Okiki Bello: Some of favorite female influencers bashing Toke actually do this thing too.

And your male influencers are going through it. But they would rather slander Toke who came out and say what she does.
25/08/2019, 14:25 - Okiki Bello: It's what some women. She just aired her own on the internet..
25/08/2019, 14:25 - Okiki Bello: Some women do*
25/08/2019, 14:26 - Eniola: Bro it is not right
No wonder her ex left her (you can be good and they will still leave you) 
Forget that thing
Nobody wants drama in this life
You ma reason am, I will just wake up one morning and sieze your car keys and say you are not going anywhere
25/08/2019, 14:27 - Eniola: Or I will just wake up on day and stay getting on your nerves so that we will fight

25/08/2019, 14:29 - Eniola: Any woman that does it are just naturally bitter and they are among the 80% of women categorized as bitter...

25/08/2019, 14:32 - Okiki Bello: Good for You. You guys don't fight?
25/08/2019, 14:32 - Eniola: It is a different case if she is misbehaving as a result of something, not that she just want to fight you
25/08/2019, 14:32 - Okiki Bello: Korede, God will bless you!
25/08/2019, 14:33 - Eniola: No say because that is how girls behave, you go come go enter abusive relationship. No die abeg o
I still love you
25/08/2019, 14:33 - Korede: You make the word "fight" sound like a brawl or serious fight... 
Na just something dey do sometimes or rare occasions.
25/08/2019, 14:33 - Osuya: Although, I no see her post bt I'd say a larger percentage of women do dis, it's more like an inbuilt thing, u've jst gotta be mature enough to handle d madness wen it comes
25/08/2019, 14:33 - Okiki Bello: Korede.. I am pleased with you!
25/08/2019, 14:33 - Korede: Agreed.
25/08/2019, 14:33 - Eniola: Baba they be winch
There are various ways you can find out if someone cares about you, not by finding trouble.
25/08/2019, 14:34 - Okiki Bello: Thank you, bro
25/08/2019, 14:34 - Korede: 🤦🏾‍♂
25/08/2019, 14:34 - Okiki Bello: It's not trouble!
25/08/2019, 14:34 - Eniola: We quarrel
Not because she said we must fight, events happens that lead to quarrel
25/08/2019, 14:34 - Eniola: Baba mi

25/08/2019, 14:35 - Korede: My Brother, go ask women around you about this. 

Sometimes they intentionally look for trouble for some reasons 
1. To get your attention 
2. Affection 
Etc.
25/08/2019, 14:35 - Eniola: Baba na the women weh you deh meet be that
25/08/2019, 14:35 - Korede: When it comes to women, nothing has to really happen for a "quarrel" to ensue.
25/08/2019, 14:36 - Korede: Guy. I might be overstating this but go and ask Mummy first. She's a woman. She'll better explain to you. 
I'm serious.
25/08/2019, 14:37 - Eniola: That was how I saw a post that a girl said she can't date a guy that will not beat her. That when a guy beats herd it means the guy loves her
25/08/2019, 14:37 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please I hate this table
25/08/2019, 14:37 - Eniola: As I said, it depends on the ones you might have met
25/08/2019, 14:38 - SUG: Enny is right thou
25/08/2019, 14:38 - Eniola: Baba I sabi my mumsi
Nothing to ask her
25/08/2019, 14:38 - Korede: I'm not saying mummy is like that but I'm asking you to ask her about women in general.
25/08/2019, 14:39 - SUG: Actually not all ladies do that purposefully to gain attention
25/08/2019, 14:39 - Korede: That one is mental.
25/08/2019, 14:39 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣
25/08/2019, 14:40 - Korede: It is something that is wired into them (not all sha). 

Infact they do it sometimes to teach you a valuable lesson.
25/08/2019, 14:40 - Korede: Without patience and maturity, you'll not cope if a woman does this to you.
25/08/2019, 14:41 - SUG: If you know the definition of peace of mind ehn 
🤣🤣🤣
25/08/2019, 14:41 - Korede: The fact is that it will help you develop patience.
25/08/2019, 14:41 - SUG: Some ladies are like that

Enny should understand
25/08/2019, 14:41 - Korede: They are not bitter.
25/08/2019, 14:42 - SUG: Some are bittered
25/08/2019, 14:42 - Korede: Every bloody woman has the ability to do this thing. EVERY WOMAN.
25/08/2019, 14:43 - Osuya: Eniola, if u eventually meet a girl u love, I mean love dat makes u lose ur natural senses, if she does dat u'll adapt to it and u can subsequently re-align her mental or emotional state (I no know d exact one wey dey make dem misbehave) to suit u
25/08/2019, 14:43 - SUG: U don't hear what toke said ni


She said she will develop drama when his going for interview or he won a contract or going for an important meeting 

Ahhhh
Go and hear the rubbish
25/08/2019, 14:43 - Korede: If you don't accept this fact that any woman can do this to you (i.e. Bring "trouble" or "quarrel" from nothing), you won't be able to live with anyone of them.
25/08/2019, 14:44 - Eniola: See, women are different
It all depends on the way they were raised and what they have faced when growing up. There are ladies that won't disturb your life at all, anyone that disturbs your life na winch. Majority of Nigerian ladies are troublesome, but not all.
25/08/2019, 14:44 - Eniola: No
Na the same thing we deh talk
Shey na affection you deh talk since na
25/08/2019, 14:44 - Osuya: Dis one like Eniola said is d guy's village people annex right in his house
25/08/2019, 14:44 - Korede: I'm not saying a Nagging or quarrelsome wife/woman is good ooo, even bible condemns it. 
But I'm saying, occasionally or even rarely they do throw tantrums for whatever reasons or the other.
25/08/2019, 14:44 - Eniola: Baba all of them are mental
25/08/2019, 14:45 - Korede: Guy it's okay.
25/08/2019, 14:45 - Korede: We are clearly not chasing similar points.
25/08/2019, 14:45 - Eniola: They are bittered baba mi
25/08/2019, 14:45 - Korede: Na so.
25/08/2019, 14:45 - Korede: Na so.
25/08/2019, 14:46 - Eniola: No o
Na same point
They are both looking if you have affection for them
25/08/2019, 14:46 - Korede: I am almost certain that if you ask Mummy, she will drive home my point for you.
25/08/2019, 14:46 - Eniola: Baba you lie
25/08/2019, 14:46 - Eniola: It is okay
25/08/2019, 14:47 - Eniola: You guys have stated yours, I have stated mine
25/08/2019, 14:47 - Korede: I no even do again. Believe what you will. You kuku are the expert.
25/08/2019, 14:47 - Eniola: Toke that is every month drama upon drama
25/08/2019, 14:47 - Eniola: Yes boss
You too
25/08/2019, 14:48 - Eniola: 2-1
25/08/2019, 16:22 - Okiki Bello: 😁😁😁... I am pleased
25/08/2019, 16:23 - Okiki Bello: That's why i said she said hers to the extreme!
25/08/2019, 16:25 - Orisa: Lol
25/08/2019, 16:28 - Oluwatobi K: 💯
25/08/2019, 16:36 - Okiki Bello: Lol.. Forget. Whoever wants to be an ogbanje would be an ogbanje. Forget movies, books and mentors
25/08/2019, 16:41 - Orisa: Even with the books and everything they read sef, even for some of them that read, watch, listen to d good stuffs sef

Most of dem don't act from the point of their study

Na emotions most of them they think from. No. B brain

So their actions majorly are form their emotions at that moment u just have to adjust as they keep adjusting ni

They are really really complex set of creature
25/08/2019, 16:41 - Korede: 🌝
25/08/2019, 16:42 - Okiki Bello: 👊🏽👊🏽
25/08/2019, 16:42 - Korede: Not that complex.
25/08/2019, 16:43 - Okiki Bello: 😁 But they are.
25/08/2019, 16:43 - Orisa: Even if it's a minute complexity.

They are the virtue of being complex there
25/08/2019, 16:43 - Eniola: Just seeing this
Till then bro
25/08/2019, 16:43 - Oluwatobi K: We're talking about those who doesn't want to be ogbanje sir.. 

🤷🏾‍♂
25/08/2019, 16:44 - Okiki Bello: Read this again, Papa Tobi!
25/08/2019, 16:44 - SUG: 👍🏼👍🏼
25/08/2019, 16:44 - Oluwatobi K: I read it...

And I picked the point...
25/08/2019, 16:44 - Eniola: 👍🏽
25/08/2019, 16:44 - Okiki Bello: Good for us all
25/08/2019, 16:45 - Orisa: Pápá tóbi ehn... All. Of them get this iota of emotional action at some point
25/08/2019, 16:45 - Korede: I just want us to understand that sometimes their acting from their "emotions" is normal (I mean normal for their chromosome). 
God made them to be the more emotional out of us.
25/08/2019, 16:45 - Orisa: Especially wen dey now like u
25/08/2019, 16:45 - Oluwatobi K: Your focus from this reply is for those who wants to be "ogbanje"...

And I'm focusing my point on those who doesn't want to be and what they need to do!!!.
25/08/2019, 16:45 - Korede: Experience is talking. 🌝
25/08/2019, 16:46 - Okiki Bello: The thing is Ola, Eniola and papa haven't really seen what we have seen!
25/08/2019, 16:46 - Orisa: Eh eh!!

Where are we going to. Now
25/08/2019, 16:46 - Oluwatobi K: Everybody has emotion sir.

Ladies emotion seems to be more.

That's how God created them...
25/08/2019, 16:46 - Orisa: Oyaaa

She with us
25/08/2019, 16:46 - SUG: What we are saying is

We know that they are like that, emotions

Just saying, for people who will listen to toke and act on her words 

Not that ladies are not emotionally inclined
25/08/2019, 16:46 - Eniola: I don't plan seeing it
25/08/2019, 16:47 - Orisa: No. Mind toke joor

Dt one na witchcraft
25/08/2019, 16:47 - SUG: What it we have seen

Must I say everything
Me act cool and you won't know
25/08/2019, 16:47 - Okiki Bello: I am not saying anybody should listen to Toke. What i am saying is. Most of this girls do this thing alot and they are bashing Toke
25/08/2019, 16:47 - Korede: I will say this now... 
No matter how grounded a lady is in Christ, the word and understanding ehn, 

Acting out from her emotions will almost certainly occur. Forget it. 

If you are expecting that 'cos a lady has all these things she won't do that... Pfft. 

It is their wiring. 
It should not just be too much. Overdo na die.
25/08/2019, 16:48 - Orisa: Dtx wah m. Saying na

Imagine someone waking up in the morning and u guys are smiling some minutes later

boom

Mood swing
25/08/2019, 16:48 - Korede: This message was deleted
25/08/2019, 16:48 - Okiki Bello: Lmao... Bro.. You know this!
25/08/2019, 16:48 - Oluwatobi K: So.?

Patapata you had a bad experience from a past relationship? 

And I get what you're saying..
25/08/2019, 16:48 - Orisa: Baba all. Of dem get skuchis for head
25/08/2019, 16:48 - Korede: 😒
25/08/2019, 16:48 - Korede: 🤣
25/08/2019, 16:48 - Okiki Bello: Bad experience.. I swear.. Its  interesting
25/08/2019, 16:48 - Oluwatobi K: Exactly sir..
25/08/2019, 16:49 - Okiki Bello: Ola.. Look at this again. Read carefully. This is my point
25/08/2019, 16:49 - SUG: We all know they do so ooo

That is their nature 
That is their creation

What we are now saying is
Acting upon what you hear from bad friends and ur environment
25/08/2019, 16:49 - Orisa: She never really. Like u or u guys neva really close na y u. Neva c d madness
25/08/2019, 16:49 - Eniola: That is what I am saying
Most of this people agreeing with it is because of what they have faced d in their past relationships, so they have programmed their mind that things are meant to be aligned that way
25/08/2019, 16:49 - Korede: See ehn, the Internet is full of people like that. 
You'll see someone condemn a person on Internet without putting in mind our actions. Leave them.
25/08/2019, 16:50 - Okiki Bello: Orisa... Thank you o
25/08/2019, 16:50 - Okiki Bello: That's my point.
25/08/2019, 16:50 - Korede: Na that's wrong. You don't base your actions on someone's else ish. I agree with you jaare.
25/08/2019, 16:50 - Okiki Bello: In fact.. I miss it sef
25/08/2019, 16:50 - SUG: See ehn

I don't want to people to act on your emotions too

That is how u will get the bigger picture
25/08/2019, 16:50 - Orisa: Awwwn awnnn
25/08/2019, 16:50 - Korede: Someone's Cousin. Shey you guys have no respect ni.
25/08/2019, 16:50 - Okiki Bello: I swear...
25/08/2019, 16:51 - Oluwatobi K: @2348167554754 @2349066181649 ...
25/08/2019, 16:51 - Orisa: How will someone be happy and u will say u want him to. Be troubled den u will. Now. Send pictures

25/08/2019, 16:51 - Eniola: The thing is that most people believe they must act according to their zodiac sign
25/08/2019, 16:52 - SUG: For example now

Toke makinwa has a bad marriage , a broken home

Now she came to social media and advice ladies on how to treat their husband

Are getting my own point
25/08/2019, 16:52 - Korede: Delusions.
25/08/2019, 16:52 - Eniola: Her point from the video is her justifying that she is crazy because she is scorpion or scorpio, I no even sabi the spelling self
25/08/2019, 16:52 - Korede: Imagine the irony.
25/08/2019, 16:52 - Okiki Bello: She riles you up so you can say "Ma binu, na" and "You know i love you so much" and she gives you a special treat.. I swear... I love and miss the drama
25/08/2019, 16:52 - Orisa: Am. Not speaking from emotions now

M telling u from what have seen over time and have occurred even with career ladies, spiritual ladies

Once dey get comfortable with u

Hmmm
25/08/2019, 16:52 - Korede: Even if na Turkey.
25/08/2019, 16:52 - Orisa: Ẹ Don do. U na
25/08/2019, 16:53 - Korede: Wrong group.
25/08/2019, 16:53 - Orisa: Lol..... Or orangutan sef
25/08/2019, 16:53 - Okiki Bello: How do you know she was the cause of her bad marriage?
25/08/2019, 16:53 - Eniola: Most of you did not watch the video
25/08/2019, 16:53 - Korede: Wait isn't this group for discussing Football?!
25/08/2019, 16:53 - Eniola: Please go and watch the video before ranting here
25/08/2019, 16:53 - Korede: He was just stating the obvious.
25/08/2019, 16:53 - Orisa: Sure I Sabi wetn u dey try proof
25/08/2019, 16:54 - Korede: Language.
25/08/2019, 16:54 - Eniola: Imagine someone saying she knows her husband does not get pissed off on Thursday and that is the day he does his meeting. That she will make sure she gives him hell that day
25/08/2019, 16:54 - Orisa: Wen will. U learn

Which one is ranting
25/08/2019, 16:54 - Eniola: Is this an example of emotion
25/08/2019, 16:54 - Eniola: Ranting is not insultive
25/08/2019, 16:54 - Eniola: Sorry
25/08/2019, 16:54 - SUG: See ehn 
Once the get comfortable with u 

They can get angry because your are not angry

And they will be angry because because u are angry

Now that is them
Those not mean they are not cool, they are expressing something out of their body

Meanwhile
Guys have their own way of expressing theirs too
25/08/2019, 16:55 - Korede: Ehn that's her. And that's extreme.
25/08/2019, 16:55 - Oluwatobi K: We are not this things doesn't exist...

We are saying changes can occur if they feed on *positive things.* , For those who are ready to ..

Simple.
25/08/2019, 16:55 - Okiki Bello: Eniola. I am not siding her. What i am saying is. She took hers to the extreme. But most ladies do it
25/08/2019, 16:55 - Orisa: Ehn ehn

We are just agreeing to. Something

Na wetn I dey try talk. B dr
25/08/2019, 16:55 - Korede: It is an extreme example. 

But basing your final conclusion on women based on Toke is biased. 🤷🏾‍♂
25/08/2019, 16:55 - Eniola: It is well
I am out
I wan watch Tottenham match
25/08/2019, 16:55 - Eniola: I go update una scores
25/08/2019, 16:55 - SUG: Saying

That was the point I made that was ignored
25/08/2019, 16:56 - Eniola: 1-0
25/08/2019, 16:56 - Eniola: Tottenham deh lose
25/08/2019, 16:56 - Orisa: Last I checked this is wah ranting meant

to talk loudly and in a way that shows anger : to complain in a way that is unreasonable
25/08/2019, 16:56 - SUG: U say
25/08/2019, 16:56 - Eniola: 1-0

25/08/2019, 17:03 - Okiki Bello: You would feel Pep would start B. Silva. Baba could just start Forden or David Silva
25/08/2019, 17:03 - Korede: He will definitely score.
25/08/2019, 17:04 - Okiki Bello: You think he would start Aguero. Baba would just start Jesus.

25/08/2019, 17:07 - Korede: Okay. You used "And". I misunderstood

25/08/2019, 17:11 - Korede: Firmino is not just consistent in terms of goals.
25/08/2019, 17:11 - Okiki Bello: He always does. Even if it's penalty
25/08/2019, 17:11 - Korede: And you are an Arsenal fan. FPL can cause trouble. 🤣

15/09/2019, 18:12 - Korede: Should be next week.
15/09/2019, 18:12 - Korede: They are our next game I guess.
15/09/2019, 18:13 - Ayodele Adewale: Second game Luiz is costing you guys a penalty
15/09/2019, 18:13 - Okiki Bello: That guy is not a remedy. He is another calamity

15/09/2019, 18:21 - SUG: I just believe u

😂😂😂😂
15/09/2019, 18:22 - Timi: Tactically the guy is poor
15/09/2019, 18:23 - Korede: Ever since he started Willock or Warlock against Liverpool, I knew Okiki was a better choice to Emery. 😆
15/09/2019, 18:23 - Korede: But he dribbled Van Dijk na. 


Na till DECEMBER before hin go score. 🤣

19/09/2019, 12:37 - Okiki Bello: In our FPL league, GG is representing Arsenal well on the table. 7th. Guess the 23rd person and relegation candidate!
19/09/2019, 12:41 - Korede: Ola that is 3rd nko??
19/09/2019, 12:41 - Korede: Simeon
19/09/2019, 12:42 - Okiki Bello: That one is fluctuating.
19/09/2019, 12:43 - Okiki Bello: And i think he was above me before o
19/09/2019, 12:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Doing better than Arsenal therefore not representing them well
19/09/2019, 12:43 - Korede: Yeah. I got. 😆
19/09/2019, 12:45 - Okiki Bello: Korede sef don enter 14th
19/09/2019, 12:45 - Okiki Bello: I thought you were topping before o. 🤣🤣
19/09/2019, 12:47 - Ayodele Adewale: He has never topped this season
19/09/2019, 12:48 - Korede: Nah. I don't top at the beginning of season.
19/09/2019, 12:48 - Korede: When you put it like that... 😒
19/09/2019, 12:49 - Korede: Kane out for Aubameyang. Solid choice or...
19/09/2019, 12:49 - Okiki Bello: It sounded the way BB wanted it to. You know this.
19/09/2019, 12:50 - Ayodele Adewale: Solid I guess
19/09/2019, 12:50 - Korede: You are guessing. Nothing is ever solid with this FPL game. 😭
19/09/2019, 12:50 - Korede: I know. 😪
19/09/2019, 12:51 - Okiki Bello: Kane is an idiot. They are playing leceister.
19/09/2019, 12:51 - Ayodele Adewale: You want to be certain so that if it backfires you will have someone to blame
19/09/2019, 12:51 - Okiki Bello: The guy might score three like that.
19/09/2019, 12:51 - Okiki Bello: I have both Kane and Aubameyang!
19/09/2019, 12:53 - Korede: My point exactly. But he has easier games than Auba. 

Last last I'll pick my Firmino.
19/09/2019, 12:54 - Korede: I will never blame you... That much.
19/09/2019, 12:54 - Korede: Thief.
19/09/2019, 12:55 - Ayodele Adewale: And you decided to captain De B
Lwkmd 
The Lord fights for His own
19/09/2019, 12:55 - Okiki Bello: You can never know, bro!
19/09/2019, 12:55 - Oluwatobi K: Leeemaaooo😅
19/09/2019, 12:55 - Okiki Bello: Are you minding him?
19/09/2019, 12:55 - Korede: <Media omitted>
19/09/2019, 12:56 - Ayodele Adewale: I am laughing at your choice of captain last week
19/09/2019, 12:56 - Oluwatobi K: Lol.
19/09/2019, 12:57 - Korede: Anyways. Liverpool defenders are whack. Only for assists that's why they are there. 

Salah and Sterling must perform ooo. 


Pukki still surest for now. Okay there's Aguero and Tamilore.
19/09/2019, 12:57 - Okiki Bello: I know.
19/09/2019, 12:57 - Korede: Liverpool vs Chelsea. 😭

No clean sheet for Liverpool again! 😭😭
19/09/2019, 12:57 - Korede: Alisson come back to me. Please.
19/09/2019, 12:58 - Ayodele Adewale: Good
19/09/2019, 12:58 - Okiki Bello: Tammy?? Against VVD? Pls!
19/09/2019, 12:58 - Okiki Bello: But you know this game is all about taking some risk. Calculated risk 🤣🤣
19/09/2019, 12:58 - Oluwatobi K: It will shock you.
19/09/2019, 12:59 - Korede: All the people scoring when VVD was there nko?! 💁🏾‍♂
19/09/2019, 12:59 - Korede: You think Tammy is Pepe bah?!
19/09/2019, 12:59 - Oluwatobi K: Anyways, my team remains the same..

Except I see better reasons before kick off.
19/09/2019, 13:00 - Ayodele Adewale: As far as I am concerned the only MAN CITY player worth the risk is Sterling
19/09/2019, 13:00 - Korede: Leno still your Keeper? 😒
19/09/2019, 13:00 - Okiki Bello: Shocker ni.
19/09/2019, 13:00 - Oluwatobi K: Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee.

Don't go there..
19/09/2019, 13:00 - Korede: You've said it.
19/09/2019, 13:00 - Korede: Na only hin shirt sure for now sef.
19/09/2019, 13:00 - Ayodele Adewale: Man City will win games no doubt but their squad rotation is crazy
19/09/2019, 13:01 - Korede: I've gone and come back. 😒
19/09/2019, 13:01 - Oluwatobi K: Yea..  

I want to wait till I can make proper arrangements next game week..
19/09/2019, 13:01 - Okiki Bello: Except for the fact that he has missed chances, he has had successful take ons and successful dribbles. Na goals remain
19/09/2019, 13:01 - Korede: And bloody annoying.
19/09/2019, 13:01 - Okiki Bello: You forgot they lost against Norwich
19/09/2019, 13:01 - Korede: <Media omitted>
19/09/2019, 13:01 - Oluwatobi K: Extremely Crazy.

And it was part of the what cost them last GW...
19/09/2019, 13:01 - Korede: Okay.
19/09/2019, 13:01 - Okiki Bello: Actually, Laporte is out, Stones is out too
19/09/2019, 13:02 - Korede: Anyways I have Sterling, David Silva.
19/09/2019, 13:02 - Ayodele Adewale: I am not talking about injuries now baba
19/09/2019, 13:03 - Okiki Bello: Norwich played them with passing game. It was unexpected
19/09/2019, 13:03 - Oluwatobi K: My only issue now is who to captain 🤨
19/09/2019, 13:03 - Ayodele Adewale: This match it's Bernado Silva. 
Next match it's Mahrez
19/09/2019, 13:04 - Ayodele Adewale: You obviously don't understand what I am talking about
19/09/2019, 13:04 - Korede: Frustrating.
19/09/2019, 13:04 - Oluwatobi K: Yea
19/09/2019, 13:04 - Okiki Bello: I am saying, they might start experiencing some problems at the back if those two aren't back
19/09/2019, 13:05 - Korede: Fernandinho will try his best there.
19/09/2019, 13:05 - Ayodele Adewale: That's their problem 
What I am talking about is how their rotation affects FPL
19/09/2019, 13:05 - Oluwatobi K: I was really surprised when Debruyne didn't start against Norwich...

Stupid gamble..
19/09/2019, 13:05 - Korede: They should even have those problems gan. It pays us.
19/09/2019, 13:05 - Okiki Bello: Okay!
19/09/2019, 13:05 - Korede: Pained me for Okiki.
19/09/2019, 13:06 - Okiki Bello: He might not consider rotating De bruyne again
19/09/2019, 13:06 - Okiki Bello: I was pained for myself
19/09/2019, 13:06 - Ayodele Adewale: You obviously don't know the bald man
19/09/2019, 13:06 - Korede: If he does then he is definitely related to Emery.
19/09/2019, 13:07 - Korede: <Media omitted>
19/09/2019, 13:07 - Okiki Bello: 🤣🤣. You should have just said alakori
19/09/2019, 13:07 - Okiki Bello: Spanish bros!
19/09/2019, 13:07 - Korede: All join.
19/09/2019, 13:08 - Korede: So are we buying Tamilore? Or...
19/09/2019, 13:08 - Oluwatobi K: Lol....
19/09/2019, 13:08 - Korede: I don't have one Chelsea player. It's unfair.
19/09/2019, 13:08 - Okiki Bello: What's his cost?
19/09/2019, 13:08 - Okiki Bello: Me, too!
19/09/2019, 13:08 - Oluwatobi K: Must you involve us in your samples? 🤣
19/09/2019, 13:08 - Korede: Less than 8m I guess.
19/09/2019, 13:09 - Korede: <Media omitted>
19/09/2019, 13:09 - Okiki Bello: I had high hopes for Pulisic, but Nigga hasn't really done well
19/09/2019, 13:10 - Ayodele Adewale: I have Mount
19/09/2019, 13:10 - Okiki Bello: I don't have any Man utd player too!
19/09/2019, 13:10 - Korede: Pulisic ko... Mount or Tammy are better FPL choices for now sha.
19/09/2019, 13:10 - Okiki Bello: Yes. I have mount. And i just bought him.
19/09/2019, 13:10 - Okiki Bello: Please Chelsea fans, is he going to available for next match.
19/09/2019, 13:10 - Korede: I have De gea. So far only one gw in which he gave me something.
19/09/2019, 13:10 - Korede: No goalie sure for clean sheet sef.
19/09/2019, 13:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol
You don know He isn't sure of starting right
19/09/2019, 13:11 - Ayodele Adewale: You mean two
19/09/2019, 13:11 - Oluwatobi K: It's only Tammy that is worth buying in Chelsea..

I prefer Pukki to him for GW6 tho.
19/09/2019, 13:11 - Korede: Nope!
19/09/2019, 13:11 - Korede: Just one. Didn't have him then.
19/09/2019, 13:11 - Ayodele Adewale: 75% chance of playing
19/09/2019, 13:11 - Korede: Before nko. Pukki stays.
19/09/2019, 13:11 - Oluwatobi K: Are you sure he'll start? Hope the injury didn't affect him?
19/09/2019, 13:11 - Okiki Bello: Lloris?
19/09/2019, 13:11 - Korede: I hope he won't play ni.
19/09/2019, 13:12 - Korede: Tottenham. Please. 😒
19/09/2019, 13:12 - Korede: That Vardy will score against.
19/09/2019, 13:12 - Oluwatobi K: That's why I didn't bother changing Leno.
19/09/2019, 13:12 - Ayodele Adewale: Ohkay
19/09/2019, 13:12 - Korede: Honestly. I get your drift.
19/09/2019, 13:12 - Oluwatobi K: Lol..
19/09/2019, 13:13 - Korede: Alisson should come back ooo
19/09/2019, 13:13 - Ayodele Adewale: I am not sure he will start but since the injury is not serious I can just put him on the bench instead of transferring him out
19/09/2019, 13:14 - Korede: This season just dey vex me. 
Gks nonsense. 
Defence nonsense. 
😭😭😭
19/09/2019, 13:14 - Korede: BB is on the wheel.
19/09/2019, 13:15 - Korede: Kane or Aubameyang still lingering over my head. 

That Aguero own is just nonsense. Person go buy am na and na Gabriel go start.
19/09/2019, 13:16 - Ayodele Adewale: Thank you
19/09/2019, 13:17 - Okiki Bello: Ole "Ayodele" Gunnar
19/09/2019, 13:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Still thinking about just leaving my team the way it is
19/09/2019, 13:17 - Okiki Bello: Buy both Kane and Aubameyang.. Its the real deal
19/09/2019, 13:17 - Korede: Would probably do a better job than Solksjaer. 💁🏾‍♂
19/09/2019, 13:17 - Okiki Bello: That i don't know ☹😕
19/09/2019, 13:18 - Korede: Me too ooo. But... Moutinho is going abeg.
19/09/2019, 13:18 - Okiki Bello: Wolves?
19/09/2019, 13:18 - Korede: With which money?! You think they gave me 200m?! 😒
19/09/2019, 13:18 - Korede: Ehn na.
19/09/2019, 13:18 - Korede: Just one gw that he has performed in for me.
19/09/2019, 13:18 - Okiki Bello: Did i use cheat to buy the two?
19/09/2019, 13:20 - Ayodele Adewale: You bought the two when
19/09/2019, 13:20 - Korede: You are Emery na.
19/09/2019, 13:20 - Korede: Rodrigo or Ceballos?? Someone should educate me please.
19/09/2019, 13:21 - Okiki Bello: I paid in installment, bah?
19/09/2019, 13:21 - Okiki Bello: Man city rotation.
19/09/2019, 13:21 - Okiki Bello: Ceballos
19/09/2019, 13:21 - Okiki Bello: The Beginning
19/09/2019, 13:21 - Korede: <Media omitted>
19/09/2019, 13:22 - Okiki Bello: 😏😏😏😏
19/09/2019, 13:22 - Korede: Rodrigo looks like one who starts most of the time. Anyways I have decided...
19/09/2019, 13:23 - Okiki Bello: Rodrigo!
19/09/2019, 13:23 - Okiki Bello: ?
19/09/2019, 13:23 - Ayodele Adewale: It's easier to buy them like that in the beginning
19/09/2019, 13:23 - Okiki Bello: Well... Maybe
19/09/2019, 13:23 - Korede: Ceballos. He is an attacker. Can score or sneak in an assist.
19/09/2019, 13:24 - Okiki Bello: Good for you!
19/09/2019, 13:24 - Korede: Which one is maybe again. Unless I use my wildcard, I am not getting those two.
19/09/2019, 13:25 - Okiki Bello: The only Arsenal player i have is Aubameyang, i don't trust the rest
19/09/2019, 13:25 - Ayodele Adewale: Yeah
It is
You still have the ability to play around well
19/09/2019, 13:25 - Korede: Thank you for discouraging me Okiki.
19/09/2019, 13:25 - Okiki Bello: 🤣🤣
19/09/2019, 13:26 - Okiki Bello: Ceballos is a fine player!
19/09/2019, 13:26 - Korede: <Media omitted>
19/09/2019, 13:27 - Okiki Bello: 🤣🤣.. He might have an assist next match
19/09/2019, 13:27 - Korede: Abegi.
19/09/2019, 13:27 - Korede: You have done well.
19/09/2019, 13:27 - Korede: I'll just leave Moutinho alone.
19/09/2019, 13:28 - Okiki Bello: Wolves aren't playing well at the moment.
19/09/2019, 13:28 - Okiki Bello: Moutinho might have 2 points, you can guarantee Ceballos of having at least 5 or above
19/09/2019, 13:29 - Korede: <Media omitted>
19/09/2019, 13:29 - Korede: Okiki leave me ooo.

19/09/2019, 13:31 - Oluwatobi K: It will shock when Emery will bench him..

Emery is worse than Pep..
19/09/2019, 13:33 - Okiki Bello: Raul Sanhelli
19/09/2019, 13:33 - Oluwatobi K: Very true.. Protagonist Unai who doesn't have a first eleven will just scatter your plans.
19/09/2019, 13:33 - Oluwatobi K: Thanks 🤣🤣🤣..

Raul Sanhelli
19/09/2019, 13:33 - Okiki Bello: Lmao.. Please don't compare Pep to Emery again in your life
19/09/2019, 13:34 - Korede: I second this. Don't even make this mistake in your dream.
19/09/2019, 13:35 - Oluwatobi K: I'm not comparing them...

I can never compare them..
19/09/2019, 13:35 - Okiki Bello: Be comparing Emery to Sam Allardyce.
19/09/2019, 13:35 - Oluwatobi K: Maybe you should say, I shouldn't place their names together on same sentence 😅...
19/09/2019, 13:35 - Okiki Bello: Or this Man utd Scot coach that came after Ferguson
19/09/2019, 13:36 - Oluwatobi K: David Moyes..
19/09/2019, 13:36 - Okiki Bello: It's even an insult.. Write Pep name in a different message and....
19/09/2019, 13:36 - Okiki Bello: Emery's one in another
19/09/2019, 13:37 - Okiki Bello: Ehn ehn.. Emery and David Moyes!

27/09/2019, 16:05 - Korede: TOMATOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

🍅A teacher asked her students to bring some tomatoes in a plastic bag to school.
🍅Each tomato was to be given the name of a person whom that child hates.
🍅So, the number of tomatoes would be equal to the number of persons they hate.
🍅On a pre-determined day, All the children brought their tomatoes well addressed.
🍅Some had two, some had three and some had five, some even had 20 tomatoes in accordance with the number of people they hated. 
🍅The teacher then told them they had to carry the tomatoes with them everywhere they go for two weeks.
🍅As the days passed the children started to complain about the decay and smell of the tomatoes.
🍅The students who had many tomatoes complained it was very heavy to carry and the smell was too much.
🍅After a week, the teacher asked the students “How did you feel this week?”
🍅The children complained of the awful smell and heavy weight of the tomatoes, especially those who carried several tomatoes.
🍅The teacher said, “This is very similar to what you carry in your heart when you don’t like some people.
🍅Hatred makes the heart unhealthy and you carry that hatred everywhere. 
🍅If you can’t bear the smell of spoilt tomatoes for a week, imagine the impact of bitterness on your heart as you carry it daily.”
🍅The heart is a beautiful garden that needs regular cleaning of unwanted weeds. 
🍅 Forgive those who have angered you.
🍅This makes room for storing good things.
🍅Get Better, Not Bitter!!!

AIthough you may not usually forward text messages, this one makes sense. So forward it to someone or group. They might be motivated to let go and cleanse their hearts 💕 !!!!!
Love everyone😘

04/10/2019, 14:55 - Oluwatobi K: *Kevin De Bruyne🌟 Not Fit for Manchester City 🆚 Wolves*

Pep Guardiola has confirmed Kevin De Bruyne has not recovered in time to be fit for Manchester City's match with Wolves on Sunday.

The Belgian midfielder picked up a groin injury in the win over Everton last weekend and missed their Champions League win over Dinamo Zagreb.

Asked if City need to be more cautious with Belgian given his previous spells on the sidelines, Guardiola said: "No, but sometimes he is not playing or is a substitute, like at Norwich. When he feels good, he is good.

"After the international break he will be ready. It is not a big problem."

With Stones and centre-back partner Aymeric Laporte missing, Fernandinho could start at the back alongside Nicolas Otamendi for the third time in eight days.

05/10/2019, 17:42 - Korede: Never. He will play.
05/10/2019, 17:43 - Oluwatobi K: If he doesn't start, then he should not use him at all...

But I know he'll start. He's actually in form at the moment, just that debruyne and Mahrez overshadowed him. And now debruyne is out so I hope he steps up.
05/10/2019, 17:43 - Korede: He will come in have 2 assists and collect red card.
05/10/2019, 17:43 - Oluwatobi K: Lol😂😂😂
05/10/2019, 17:49 - Oluwatobi K: See ehn, Liverpool already won today.

06/10/2019, 17:19 - Oluwatobi K: So No Debruyne no Man City or what?
06/10/2019, 17:20 - Korede: I don't even understand.
06/10/2019, 17:21 - Oluwatobi K: I said anything can happen... And it actually happened, even though I wasn't expecting city to loose at home 😶
06/10/2019, 17:21 - Korede: The only source of Joy for me now will be if Manu keep a clean sheet.
06/10/2019, 17:22 - Korede: Half of my prophecy came to pass. 🤣
06/10/2019, 17:22 - Oluwatobi K: Leno kept clean sheet for me tho.
06/10/2019, 17:23 - Korede: Congratulations. 😒
06/10/2019, 17:23 - Oluwatobi K: Lol..

But Sterling tried in that match.
Wolves was just better with their formation and they sticked to their plan from kick off to final whistle.
06/10/2019, 17:25 - Okiki Bello: They defended with their lives!
06/10/2019, 17:26 - Babayomi: All these arsenal fans sef, How u go get Leno wey dey drink goals any how for team. He delivered today sha but the next clean sheet na January
06/10/2019, 17:26 - Oluwatobi K: I watched the match.

Man City lacked creativity at the front (All those invisible finishing passes). Debruyne was really missed.

Wolves played with defend well and counter plan and it really worked.

They had more clear cut chances than city.

If not that they lost opportunities in first half, it would get to 4 goals sef.
06/10/2019, 17:27 - Okiki Bello: Saying Leno drink goals like as if he concedes that much, abeg. Leno make decisive saves, tho. But i don't have him!
06/10/2019, 17:28 - Okiki Bello: Pẹ̀lẹ́ oo, Analyst Tobi.. Which one is clear cut chances, pls?
06/10/2019, 17:29 - Oluwatobi K: Lol.

When Last did your kepa keep clean sheet?

One thing about goal keepers in FPL is that none of them can give your more than 3-5 Points consistently. 

Imagine Ederson today ?
06/10/2019, 17:29 - Oluwatobi K: Did you watch the match?
06/10/2019, 17:29 - Babayomi: Lol....when I'm not mad I will have Kepa in my team
06/10/2019, 17:29 - Babayomi: *how
06/10/2019, 17:29 - Okiki Bello: I was focused on Arsenal match tho. But i watched a few!
06/10/2019, 17:29 - Oluwatobi K: Lol
06/10/2019, 17:30 - Okiki Bello: Lol
06/10/2019, 17:30 - Oluwatobi K: Alright then..
06/10/2019, 17:30 - Okiki Bello: Even Liverpool no dey keep clean sheet again
06/10/2019, 17:31 - Oluwatobi K: Couldn't watch arsenal match here.. they showed City and Chelsea..
06/10/2019, 17:31 - Oluwatobi K: Abi o
06/10/2019, 17:32 - Okiki Bello: So what's clear cut chances? I am willing to learn!
06/10/2019, 17:33 - Oluwatobi K: The meaning or the chances during the match?
06/10/2019, 18:02 - Oluwatobi K: Unai Emry should be sacked.

Look at the Man Utd he was defending against? 🤦🏾‍♂
06/10/2019, 18:04 - Oluwatobi K: Akin Alabi and BiolaKazeem will be fuming on Twitter at the moment 😅
06/10/2019, 18:04 - Ayodele Adewale: Ole can't reach end of season
06/10/2019, 18:06 - Oluwatobi K: True tho.

But is he the problem or the board did not buy players ?
06/10/2019, 18:06 - Ayodele Adewale: He is out if his depth
06/10/2019, 18:06 - Ayodele Adewale: The board is a problem true
06/10/2019, 18:06 - Oluwatobi K: Throw more light...
06/10/2019, 18:07 - Oluwatobi K: Exactly my view..
06/10/2019, 18:07 - Ayodele Adewale: But without his first choice players he is helpless
06/10/2019, 18:07 - Ayodele Adewale: He can't change tactics
06/10/2019, 18:08 - Oluwatobi K: Your first choice attackers can't compete sir...

Who do you have up front that is wold class?
 Don't mention rashford o.
06/10/2019, 18:08 - Oluwatobi K: *world
06/10/2019, 18:09 - Ayodele Adewale: Have you ever asked yourself why it's only the first game of the season United have looked threatening
06/10/2019, 18:10 - Oluwatobi K: Nope..
06/10/2019, 18:10 - Ayodele Adewale: That's the only game his game plan worked
06/10/2019, 18:10 - Ayodele Adewale: And the squad was complete
06/10/2019, 18:10 - Oluwatobi K: Ok...
06/10/2019, 18:10 - Ayodele Adewale: His only game plan was figured out after that
06/10/2019, 18:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Teams have figured him out
06/10/2019, 18:11 - Ayodele Adewale: And he can't change it
06/10/2019, 18:11 - Oluwatobi K: I see..
06/10/2019, 18:11 - Ayodele Adewale: After that first game
06/10/2019, 18:12 - Ayodele Adewale: Any other game United has scored is just by chance
06/10/2019, 18:12 - Ayodele Adewale: Not by executing any game plan
06/10/2019, 18:12 - Oluwatobi K: You guys need to visit the Market by January then..
06/10/2019, 18:13 - Ayodele Adewale: He doesn't have the personality to force them to buy
06/10/2019, 18:13 - Ayodele Adewale: The board doesn't exactly care at the moment because they are making money
06/10/2019, 18:15 - Oluwatobi K: The way arsenal did last three seasons.. And did not qualify for Champions League..
06/10/2019, 18:15 - Babayomi: Olé is doing a good job, ejor💁‍♂
06/10/2019, 18:15 - Ayodele Adewale: So we need a coach that wouldn't come and after drawing a game to an unknown team in Europa without having a single shot on target 
And be taking about how he likes how the team played
06/10/2019, 18:16 - Oluwatobi K: <Media omitted>
06/10/2019, 18:16 - Ayodele Adewale: United is losing against the worst team in the league at Old Trafford
06/10/2019, 18:16 - Oluwatobi K: I guess That's why they sacked mounrinho ...
06/10/2019, 18:16 - Babayomi: You had a coach like that in Mou but una pursue am when una suppose back am for market
06/10/2019, 18:17 - Ayodele Adewale: I am watching the game and it was obvious United had no plan of attack
06/10/2019, 18:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Muo was the coach we needed but he became toxic to quick
06/10/2019, 18:17 - Oluwatobi K: Same here
06/10/2019, 18:17 - Ayodele Adewale: He was the right coach at the wrong time
06/10/2019, 18:18 - Oluwatobi K: Because he saying the truth.
06/10/2019, 18:18 - Ayodele Adewale: If he had come in immediately after Sir Alex then we wouldn't be where we are
06/10/2019, 18:18 - Ayodele Adewale: He said the truth yes but he was destroying the dressing room
06/10/2019, 18:19 - Oluwatobi K: Oook..
06/10/2019, 18:19 - Babayomi: 🤔
06/10/2019, 18:19 - Ayodele Adewale: Even players he signed had turned against him or started turning against him
06/10/2019, 18:20 - Ayodele Adewale: He played a midfielder in Defence in a league game to prove a point
06/10/2019, 18:21 - Oluwatobi K: Wait.

Seems Matic is on the bench?
06/10/2019, 18:22 - Ayodele Adewale: Matic is gone

06/10/2019, 21:46 - Okiki Bello: Wait... 20 what??
06/10/2019, 21:46 - Okiki Bello: Million???
06/10/2019, 21:46 - Prince: *Big Brother Show: Painful Statistics of what should be an illicit business*

*Pray for Nigerian youths*

* Total number of votes cast during Britain Got talent 2017 = 6.2million votes 

* Total number of votes cast during American got talent 2017 = 52.1million votes. 
Note: American population is twice Nigeria's population.

* Mind you, most of the votes cast on either Britain or American got talent are *absolutely free* because you can vote on their websites & on the Apps without paying a dime.

*Total number of votes cast during “Big Brother Nigeria” 2018 = 170million votes @ N30 per sms for a show that contributes absolutely nothing to their lives.*

*__It is neither a talent show or life enhancing or promoting show. A show where adults are kept in a cage to freely give & take sex on National Television, while the organisers make more money from the youths.__*

If INEC organises general election this weekend and ask Nigerian youths to vote on their mobile phones @ N10 per SMS to elect leaders that will shape their futures & the country, they will ask Nigerian Government to credit their accounts 1st before they will agree to vote in that magnitude.

“Wasted Generation” ~ Prof. Wole Soyinka called them.

“A generation that play too much, sleep too much and engage in idle chatter and gossip" ~ Chief Obafemi Awolowo foresaw

“A generation of illiterate graduates” ~ Atiku Abubakar called them in 2016

A generation that are constantly not concerned about the deteriorating conditions of their senses & not bothered about their own future~ Osquare78 knows them.

We all must be wary of this generation.... they are the larger chunk of Nigerian population.

It is pathetic. 170 Million votes Multiplied by N30 = N 5.1 billion and the winner got N25 million plus an SUV worth N12 million a trip and electronics.

To destroy the future, destroy the seed (children and youths)... 

Pray for Nigeria youths to open their eyes and for God to touch the hearts of those who engage in such *illicit business.*
So so so so sad... 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
06/10/2019, 21:46 - Enny J: Naira
06/10/2019, 21:46 - Korede: Please tell him. To elucidate abeg.

06/10/2019, 21:47 - Enny J: I mean #20
A vote costs #30
The telecommunication companies will take a certain percentage out of the #30
So it will be #20 times the number of votes
06/10/2019, 21:48 - Korede: This year na 240 million votes
06/10/2019, 21:48 - Korede: Okay... You should have typed that in the first place na.
06/10/2019, 21:48 - Enny J: I don't know how much the telecommunication company took

19/10/2019, 10:25 - Oluwatobi K: Getting engagement on Twitter is not a one way thing tho.

Either you're a celeb or you post engageable contents consistently depending on specific niches..
19/10/2019, 10:25 - Ayodele Adewale: 👍👍👍
19/10/2019, 10:28 - Okiki Bello: And the same Pogba has been the one holding the team!

19/10/2019, 17:16 - Enny J: Lol, not at all
Do you know what most of this people do?
They create group like whatsapp and telegram
So when ever they make a post on Twitter, they then post the link on whatsapp or telegram
So those in the group will now go and engage on their tweet
19/10/2019, 17:16 - Enny J: How did I know?
I was in some of those group before, but I left because it is not worth it
It is just like you are buying fake engagement
Most of this trending stuff you see sometimes like guy breaking girl heart
Some of them are all planned
It all started from the whatsapp group.
19/10/2019, 17:16 - Enny J: Caucus on Twitter is on a high
19/10/2019, 17:16 - Enny J: The only people that have real engagement on their tweet are those that
1) do giveaways like pamilerin and dreylo
2) somebody future wife that post nude pictures or seductive pictures
3) those that post those rich content stuffs like Dr dipo, segalinks and the rest
4) those that can create jokes out of nothing

20/10/2019, 15:01 - Ayodele Adewale: If defenders have a good game 
Then they generally earn more points than attackers 
But captaining a defender is a calculated risk
20/10/2019, 15:01 - SUG: Baba risk
20/10/2019, 15:03 - Ayodele Adewale: Cause if them go concede na So the points go dey reduce
20/10/2019, 15:12 - Prof Makinwa: As I no get work laidis anytime any call... I dey pick anything
20/10/2019, 15:34 - Osuya: I tot De Gea was injured?!
20/10/2019, 15:36 - Ayodele Adewale: He was but we weren't too sure about how serious
20/10/2019, 15:36 - Osuya: Oh! Ok
20/10/2019, 15:37 - Osuya: D lineup for both teams looks good sha, Salah out
20/10/2019, 15:38 - Ayodele Adewale: I just hope he wasn't rushed back like pogba was rushed back
20/10/2019, 15:42 - Oluwatobi K: Bad news for some managers
20/10/2019, 15:45 - Ayodele Adewale: FPL takes too much time in showing whether a player is fit or not
20/10/2019, 15:45 - Osuya: My brother, I only have one player per 2 of d teams
20/10/2019, 15:46 - Osuya: Any way it goes
20/10/2019, 15:46 - Ayodele Adewale: There are some transfer decision I made that I wouldn't have
20/10/2019, 15:46 - Osuya: Seriously, I could av played Bissaka bt was still showing red
20/10/2019, 15:47 - Ayodele Adewale: Exactly
20/10/2019, 15:49 - Ayodele Adewale: In other news Young is playing on the wing today
20/10/2019, 15:50 - Osuya: I hope hell doesn't break loose thru him
20/10/2019, 15:51 - Osuya: And Tuanzebe too, alone in d heart of d pitch
20/10/2019, 15:51 - Osuya: Without much experience
20/10/2019, 15:51 - Ayodele Adewale: His playing defence na
20/10/2019, 15:52 - Ayodele Adewale: He played well against Arsenal and his other starts
20/10/2019, 15:52 - Osuya: Well, let's hope
20/10/2019, 15:53 - Ayodele Adewale: I don't think this is accurate
20/10/2019, 15:53 - Osuya: Except, d formation will change on d field
20/10/2019, 15:54 - Osuya: If he's playing defense, it means u guys are playing 5 defenders
20/10/2019, 15:54 - Ayodele Adewale: It should be fred in the middle
Young in freds position 
And Axel is youngs place
20/10/2019, 15:54 - Ayodele Adewale: The formation is correct just the placement of the players that is likely wrong
20/10/2019, 15:55 - Osuya: Ok
20/10/2019, 15:55 - Osuya: Cos if Young remains at dat left back, doom!
20/10/2019, 15:55 - Ayodele Adewale: But Ole is not well 
So they might actually be right
20/10/2019, 15:56 - Osuya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

27/10/2019, 19:44 - Korede: Thank God for Sokratis and Luiz. They were playing strike and defence.
27/10/2019, 19:45 - Oluwatobi K: It's a different thing to have attacking minded players and not playing attacking style/tactics...... 

Emery should give up this non sense tactics, it's clearly not working..
The players are not getting it.

A flexible manager should decode that already.
27/10/2019, 19:46 - Ayodele Adewale: But what on earth did Ozil do
27/10/2019, 19:46 - Oluwatobi K: Xhaka was very angry when he got subbed, he went to the dressing straight up pissed off.
He was booed too anyways.
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Oluwatobi K: The tactics is not just working. 🌚

27/10/2019, 19:50 - Korede: Keep saying that until Manu tops you.
27/10/2019, 19:52 - Oluwatobi K: Also the Ozil Situation should be resolved asap.

It's affecting the dressing room somehow and the recent results is adding more heat to it... Majority of the Fans are supporting him over Emery, especially because of the tactics.
27/10/2019, 19:53 - Oluwatobi K: With the way it is, emery will see out his contract.....

27/10/2019, 20:38 - Okiki Bello: Unai Emery is a very good coach! He is the first coach that believes he doesn't need a playmaker in a 4-3-3 formation
27/10/2019, 20:38 - Oluwatobi K: Lol.

He was subbed, instead of him to run out faster as per we need to score, he was walking off, the fan booed him in the process.

He signaled to the fans to keep it up, he then said _F*ck Off_.
Offed his Jersey and headed straight to the tunnel.
27/10/2019, 20:46 - Okiki Bello: Good.. All the players should protest and they should sack the very good tactless coach!
27/10/2019, 20:50 - Korede: So you guys can appoint Babayomi.

03/11/2019, 21:08 - Enny J: Additional time*
03/11/2019, 21:09 - Ayodele Adewale: It's seems it's was Aurier that caused more damage self
03/11/2019, 21:11 - Prince: I have but I dont think that injury is a leg injury 

No report from the medic yet 
I watch the match na

03/11/2019, 21:15 - Oluwatobi K: It was a tackle by Son??
03/11/2019, 21:15 - Prince: Even at the viewing centre we were saying the injury was bad 


Because son naI first call medical people before he started crying
03/11/2019, 21:15 - Ayodele Adewale: Son and Aurier
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Prince: Son hard the most impact

03/11/2019, 21:52 - Ayodele Adewale: Our group psychopath
03/11/2019, 21:53 - Korede: Thanks for the compliment.
03/11/2019, 21:54 - Korede: The Orthopaedic surgeon is going to have a blast hammering that ankle back in place. 

Gomes is out for the season!
03/11/2019, 21:55 - Ayodele Adewale: A likely part of next season
03/11/2019, 21:58 - Oluwatobi K: Certainly
03/11/2019, 21:58 - Korede: Most Probably.
03/11/2019, 21:58 - Korede: I don't wish that on any player.
03/11/2019, 21:59 - Korede: Will they video record the surgery???
03/11/2019, 21:59 - Osuya: <Media omitted>
03/11/2019, 22:00 - Ayodele Adewale: Serial killer
03/11/2019, 22:01 - Prince: Very mummurish of a person
03/11/2019, 22:01 - Korede: What na?!
03/11/2019, 22:01 - Prince: 🤣
03/11/2019, 22:01 - Prince: <Media omitted>
03/11/2019, 22:01 - Korede: I'm not that bad.
03/11/2019, 22:02 - Korede: <Media omitted>
03/11/2019, 22:02 - Korede: What's that for?! 🤣🤣🤣

I like watching surgery.
03/11/2019, 22:03 - Ayodele Adewale: I hear you
03/11/2019, 22:04 - Korede: Are you guys not seeing the beauty in this... 
The side shifted to the front. It's amazing but painful (for Gomes).
03/11/2019, 22:04 - Korede: I wish it was Babayomi's leg.
03/11/2019, 22:04 - Oluwatobi K: <Media omitted>
03/11/2019, 22:05 - Prince: <Media omitted>
03/11/2019, 22:05 - Korede: I'm joking though. I don't want Babs to break just his ankle.
03/11/2019, 22:08 - Oluwatobi K: Haaaa..

Olorun Maje o
03/11/2019, 22:08 - Korede: Amen. God forbid it.
03/11/2019, 22:09 - Oluwatobi K: 🌝
03/11/2019, 22:09 - Ayodele Adewale: @2348181807059 now you know your true friends
03/11/2019, 22:09 - Prince: Bro leave true out of it
03/11/2019, 22:09 - Prince: @2348181807059 now you know your friend
03/11/2019, 22:09 - Korede: Do you know how much he will get from settlement.
03/11/2019, 22:10 - Korede: @2348181807059 knows I love him.
03/11/2019, 22:11 - Korede: I picked Babs cos BB's leg won't break easily. Prince would probably die from the injury and SUG is already to short to have a dysfunctional ankle.
03/11/2019, 22:11 - Korede: Nobody understands me in this place. 😭

10/11/2019, 19:13 - Osuya: D Arnold's handball
10/11/2019, 19:13 - Osuya: It was supposed to be a pk
10/11/2019, 19:14 - Enny J: It was too close
10/11/2019, 19:14 - Ayodele Adewale: Was his hand in an unnatural position
10/11/2019, 19:14 - Osuya: Yes
10/11/2019, 19:14 - Enny J: If it was a far distance like 2 meters
10/11/2019, 19:14 - Osuya: 😏
10/11/2019, 19:14 - Enny J: It would have been considered
10/11/2019, 19:14 - Osuya: Bros, his hand was off his body
10/11/2019, 19:14 - Enny J: That stuff was not even up to 100cm
10/11/2019, 19:14 - Osuya: Dat's d rule
10/11/2019, 19:15 - Enny J: It is too close baba
10/11/2019, 19:15 - Osuya: Liverpool's own against spurs in d final was far abi
10/11/2019, 19:16 - Ayodele Adewale: Because it's only attacking players when the ball hits their hand then it's deemed a foul
Natural or unnatural position
10/11/2019, 19:16 - Ayodele Adewale: Different referees
10/11/2019, 19:17 - Ayodele Adewale: That's why you hear of soft penalties
10/11/2019, 19:17 - Osuya: Apparently, dat's y most managers are protesting against VAR nw
10/11/2019, 19:18 - Ayodele Adewale: The FA have managed to further mess up an already controversial tech
10/11/2019, 19:19 - Ayodele Adewale: I still wonder why on pitch referees in England never check the screen themselves
10/11/2019, 19:19 - Osuya: Seriously, it's demoralizing
10/11/2019, 19:19 - Osuya: Exactly, dey just ignore it like its not part of d system

10/11/2019, 21:26 - Okiki Bello: If any Arsenal fan here believes they would sack Emery tomorrow.. Its a big joke, fah!
10/11/2019, 21:28 - Oluwatobi K: There is nothing to believe about Arsenal till we see official News..

Other things are rumours
10/11/2019, 21:29 - Oluwatobi K: If Emery doesn't get on back on winning ways, the fans will turn on the board...

They're boycotting matches already at Emirates

10/11/2019, 21:38 - Babayomi: It's different
10/11/2019, 21:38 - Korede: Leave them. Heartless sons. If Emery was related to them will they wish such on him. This life sha...
10/11/2019, 21:39 - Korede: 🤣
10/11/2019, 21:39 - Babayomi: I'm telling you

From my best of knowledge in football
Award is given based on the past season

02/12/2019, 22:56 - Babayomi: Congratulations to Messi, I was thinking of a scenario where neither of them will win but it is possible. The bright side here is Low budget Ramos tried, if he had won it the hyping would be out of this world. They'll even call him the best defender ever. Our children and grand children won't know he wasn't as good as Ramos, Terry, Ferdinand, etc
02/12/2019, 22:56 - Okiki Bello: Is Trent-Arnold there?

08/12/2019, 22:18 - Raiden: Let's say the price now is 15000 after 50% increase over the 4 years.

Wen u free, resend d VN for ur normal tongue make person understand and learn
08/12/2019, 22:23 - Oye: This is assuming it isn't compound interest and the principal wasn't changing every year
08/12/2019, 22:24 - Enny J: Funny enough, I no need all this workings to be sincere
Just tell me the final answer weh you get make I put am for my head

08/12/2019, 22:28 - Ayodele Adewale: Come to think of it 
Can't the simple interest formula solve this 
The original price will just take the place of the principal and we'll make it the subject of the formula
08/12/2019, 22:28 - Okiki Bello: Goodnight!
08/12/2019, 22:30 - Ayodele Adewale: What Raheem said is we weren't supposed to subtract x after finding it
08/12/2019, 22:30 - Osuya: Ok, tnx👍🏾
08/12/2019, 22:31 - Kolade FUOYE: 😅
08/12/2019, 22:32 - Kolade FUOYE: 🤣
08/12/2019, 22:33 - Oye: It will work but if it's compound interest we have to remember to raise the rate by 4(since it's 4years)
08/12/2019, 22:34 - Oye: I think Raiden just used the simple interest to solve this
08/12/2019, 22:34 - Oye: And did change of subject
08/12/2019, 22:34 - SUG: Was it added over time ??
08/12/2019, 22:35 - Raiden: BB your solution is same as Olisa na (and it's correct) 


I'm saying the answer is 14*** not 11***


And your solution will give 14***
08/12/2019, 22:35 - Oye: I don't know
08/12/2019, 22:38 - Ayodele Adewale: Ohkay na
08/12/2019, 22:38 - Ayodele Adewale: It's simple interest
08/12/2019, 22:39 - Ayodele Adewale: No recruiter will people compound interest in seconds
08/12/2019, 22:40 - Oye: That's true... If they have the fear of God
08/12/2019, 22:40 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣

Let's leave to enjoy it
09/12/2019, 23:19 - Babayomi: The way they are celebrating you will think they won 3 champions league at once. Mediocre fan base 🙄
09/12/2019, 23:21 - Ayodele Adewale: As in eh 
You will think Pepe is the highest goal scorer
09/12/2019, 23:23 - Babayomi: And they play city next o 🤣
09/12/2019, 23:24 - SUG: You see them

09/12/2019, 23:47 - SUG: I will remove u now
10/12/2019, 00:46 - Okiki Bello: Lmao.. Coming from a fan whose fans trended #OleOut when they were beating Man city and after
10/12/2019, 00:48 - Okiki Bello: Just thank God, nobody had your time in this group. You first lost to West Ham and then Everton (a managerless club) and you still have to guts to throw jabs..
10/12/2019, 01:20 - Oluwatobi K: You even have time for OgA Babs... 

Awon we are using YouthTeam fans 😂😂😂
10/12/2019, 01:21 - Oluwatobi K: Give them time... 😅.

10/12/2019, 05:44 - Ayodele Adewale: Which Twitter app are using
10/12/2019, 05:44 - Ayodele Adewale: It's like there's a different one in Kano
10/12/2019, 05:46 - Ayodele Adewale: That's you guys oh
Me I throw banter at him
10/12/2019, 08:29 - Okiki Bello: BB... Really?? You want me to find out the tweets for you!
10/12/2019, 08:30 - Ayodele Adewale: On the day United won City
Baba you lie
10/12/2019, 08:31 - Ayodele Adewale: Or as I said you are using Twitter for Kano
10/12/2019, 08:43 - Oluwatobi K: Most of your Fan still wants him out sir... They believe he can not achieve anything other than challenging big teams and losing to small teams.. 🌝
10/12/2019, 08:43 - Ayodele Adewale: This is not the argument
10/12/2019, 08:43 - Ayodele Adewale: He said Ole out trended during and after the City
10/12/2019, 08:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Game
10/12/2019, 08:44 - Ayodele Adewale: And I am telling him not on Twitter
10/12/2019, 08:44 - Ayodele Adewale: Or did you see it trend??
10/12/2019, 08:53 - Oluwatobi K: Ok o... 

We shall soon see it 😁
10/12/2019, 08:53 - Ayodele Adewale: Which one is the future you are talking about bayi
10/12/2019, 08:53 - Ayodele Adewale: It has trended before 
And one bad result will make it trend again
10/12/2019, 08:54 - Ayodele Adewale: The bone of contention here is did it trend on the day Manchester United beat Manchester City at the Eithad
10/12/2019, 08:54 - Oluwatobi K: But you know this is true??
10/12/2019, 08:54 - Oluwatobi K: I don't know..
10/12/2019, 08:56 - Ayodele Adewale: Based on social media evidence it might be true
10/12/2019, 08:56 - Ayodele Adewale: Aii
10/12/2019, 09:02 - Oluwatobi K: Lol... BB boya Ke ni nice day 😁.

Best of God
10/12/2019, 09:13 - Okiki Bello: Ask other people who use twitter very well. #OleOut trended on Saturday! Infact no 3 trending!
10/12/2019, 09:14 - Okiki Bello: How did i get to know? Someone tweeted about it that Manchester united fans are not serious . That they are winning and trending #OleOut
10/12/2019, 09:15 - Ayodele Adewale: Did you even read the tweets before making noise that it trended
10/12/2019, 09:16 - Ayodele Adewale: Only one person said it will trend even if we win
10/12/2019, 09:16 - Ayodele Adewale: Then this doesn't prove it trended
10/12/2019, 09:16 - Ayodele Adewale: Simply because you searched for it
10/12/2019, 09:17 - Ayodele Adewale: I can search for any hash tag and get results
10/12/2019, 09:17 - Ayodele Adewale: I can search for Emery out and find tweets about it
10/12/2019, 09:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Doesn't mean it trended yesterday
10/12/2019, 09:25 - Okiki Bello: BB.. I am done arguing with you!
10/12/2019, 09:25 - Okiki Bello: Did you read this?
10/12/2019, 09:25 - Ayodele Adewale: I checked the trends on that day
10/12/2019, 09:25 - Okiki Bello: It was trending when i checked..
10/12/2019, 09:26 - Ayodele Adewale: That's why I am sure it didn't trend
10/12/2019, 09:26 - Okiki Bello: I bet you didn't during the match!
10/12/2019, 09:26 - Ayodele Adewale: I did
10/12/2019, 09:26 - Okiki Bello: I checked too and it was trending
10/12/2019, 09:26 - Ayodele Adewale: But did you read the tweets you dropped as proof
10/12/2019, 09:26 - Ayodele Adewale: They were bashing those that trended it before
10/12/2019, 09:27 - Ayodele Adewale: Too bad none of us have a screenshot of the trends that day
10/12/2019, 09:27 - Okiki Bello: Did you even read this? I was thinking this would be your point, that it was Mourinho fan boys that made it trend
10/12/2019, 09:27 - Okiki Bello: Just too bad.. So bad.. Very very bad
10/12/2019, 09:28 - Okiki Bello: And made it trend!
10/12/2019, 09:28 - Okiki Bello: Read this very well, i did not say they were tweeting OleOut. I said they trended!
10/12/2019, 09:29 - Ayodele Adewale: At the point you dropped this message 
You can't tell this is what you meant
10/12/2019, 09:35 - Okiki Bello: Still it trended
10/12/2019, 09:36 - Ayodele Adewale: Didn't see and you can't prove it
10/12/2019, 09:44 - Okiki Bello: Well, i did.. And that's all..
10/12/2019, 09:47 - Ayodele Adewale: You saw it but you can't prove it
10/12/2019, 09:48 - Ayodele Adewale: And I didn't see it

29/12/2019, 17:24 - Ayodele Adewale: @2348166951056 have you considered the fact that Lampard looked to his bench and got players to turn the game in his favour and Arteta didn't have anybody on the bench who could do the same
29/12/2019, 17:24 - SUG: That is just it
29/12/2019, 17:26 - Babayomi: But I love Pepe o

I was wondering what kind of jazz you used
29/12/2019, 18:11 - Korede: I thought... 😭😭😭😭

29/12/2019, 19:26 - Timi: Just to clear it up @tammyabraham still hasn't scored past a top 6 side. Arsenal are 12th. #CFC
29/12/2019, 19:26 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
29/12/2019, 19:29 - Ayodele Adewale: City has conceded
29/12/2019, 19:30 - Ayodele Adewale: VAR  to the rescue

29/12/2019, 19:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol
29/12/2019, 19:43 - Korede: 😂
29/12/2019, 20:01 - Babayomi: We agree 🤣
29/12/2019, 20:45 - Okiki Bello: Lmao... Ogbeni farabale.. Just two games you are shouting already..
29/12/2019, 20:46 - SUG: Arsenal no get player
29/12/2019, 20:46 - Okiki Bello: Arsenal didn't defend.. Chelsea had much more of the ball..
29/12/2019, 20:46 - Timi: The second half wasn't it bruv
29/12/2019, 20:46 - Okiki Bello: And again.. No players
29/12/2019, 20:47 - Timi: Ok
29/12/2019, 20:47 - SUG: It was just too obvious
29/12/2019, 20:47 - SUG: No good player
29/12/2019, 20:47 - Okiki Bello: I don't understand why Timi is shouting about Arteta fucking up..
29/12/2019, 20:47 - SUG: The guy is working on arsenal 

And it is even obvious
29/12/2019, 20:48 - SUG: Injury kill arsenal
29/12/2019, 20:48 - Okiki Bello: Two weeks, did you expect them to start playing like Man city already? Against a Chelsea team that have gelled all season
29/12/2019, 20:48 - Okiki Bello: Not only injury
29/12/2019, 20:48 - Okiki Bello: Torreira and Guendouzi would never work.. Never!
29/12/2019, 20:48 - SUG: See ehn
Player now even dey
29/12/2019, 20:50 - Okiki Bello: Guendouzi doesn't know how to tackle, isn't even good defensively.. You people can hate on Xhaka how you like.. But Xhaka would have stood in the front of the defence.. Never caught up in attack. Never!
29/12/2019, 20:50 - Okiki Bello: Torreira likes attacking, Guendouzi likes attacking.. No defensive midfielder that would stand behind!
29/12/2019, 20:51 - SUG: See ehn
29/12/2019, 20:51 - SUG: I no blame arteta at all
29/12/2019, 20:51 - Timi: Why playing defensive game when we all know that the team is shit
29/12/2019, 20:52 - Okiki Bello: Overall, our defence is not the worst. They are trying, but they don't have a defensive midfielder. Like Fernandinho to Man city defence or Joao moutinho to wolves. Or Fabinho to Liverpool!
29/12/2019, 20:52 - SUG: It was not is fault for playing defensive game oo
29/12/2019, 20:52 - SUG: 🥺🥺🥺🥺
29/12/2019, 20:52 - SUG: 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
29/12/2019, 20:52 - Okiki Bello: Ogbeni, Arsenal didn't play defensive game
29/12/2019, 20:55 - Babayomi: Gell ko gelato nii 🤣
29/12/2019, 20:58 - Okiki Bello: It's your day..
29/12/2019, 20:58 - Okiki Bello: But you understood what i meant.. So fuck off
29/12/2019, 20:59 - Timi: 2nd half was full of attack lol
29/12/2019, 20:59 - Babayomi: Lol, no be fight naa
29/12/2019, 20:59 - Okiki Bello: My goodness!!!
29/12/2019, 21:00 - Okiki Bello: When an opposition have more of the ball, do you attack or defend?
29/12/2019, 21:01 - Ayodele Adewale: 🍷🍷🍿🍿
29/12/2019, 21:04 - Okiki Bello: See.. My point is, you can't blame the coach. Most of our players are deadwood.. Give him two transfer windows before you start shouting "Same old Arsenal"..
29/12/2019, 21:04 - Okiki Bello: Yawo!!
29/12/2019, 21:04 - Babayomi: Exactly! Thank you Okiki
29/12/2019, 21:05 - Okiki Bello: Lmao.. That i was thinking you were going to write about Lampard not having a transfer window!

01/01/2020, 21:15 - Babayomi: Before nko, I go tear una part
01/01/2020, 21:15 - Okiki Bello: I fear Man utd counter attack sha.. James, Martial and Rashford are too good on Counter attack.. Especially James and Rashford
01/01/2020, 21:16 - Babayomi: Forget, Man u no sabi play small teams. Dem no fit win
01/01/2020, 21:17 - Okiki Bello: Lol.. I won't argue! Yes. Arsenal is a small team!
01/01/2020, 21:18 - Babayomi: 😅
01/01/2020, 21:19 - Okiki Bello: You remember the 4-0 trashing beginning of the season!

01/01/2020, 21:54 - SUG: Mumu
01/01/2020, 21:55 - Oluwatobi K: Lol
01/01/2020, 21:55 - Korede: Pepe scores against Manu. Doesn't get any better than that.
01/01/2020, 21:59 - Oluwatobi K: Once Lingard scores, no matter the scoreline, Man Utd gets the three points. 🌝
01/01/2020, 22:01 - Korede: Lingard can't score.
01/01/2020, 22:12 - Prince: All the time man
01/01/2020, 22:52 - Okiki Bello: Timi.. If you watched the match, you might realize how important Xhaka is to that squad and our defence!
01/01/2020, 22:58 - Timi: Not watching 😭😭😭
01/01/2020, 22:58 - Okiki Bello: Ehyah!!! Arsenal played well, sha
01/01/2020, 22:59 - Oluwatobi K: With Torriera tho..
01/01/2020, 23:00 - Timi: How did the team fare
01/01/2020, 23:00 - SUG: If we had xhaka against Chelsea 

It wouldn't have turn out that way
01/01/2020, 23:00 - Okiki Bello: Yes... That's i said we we were going to lose the Chelsea match immediately i saw Torreira and Guendouzi!
01/01/2020, 23:01 - Okiki Bello: Now you are seeing my point!
01/01/2020, 23:01 - SUG: Arteta understand the game wella
01/01/2020, 23:01 - Oluwatobi K: Can someone please invite BB here 🌚
01/01/2020, 23:01 - Timi: Hmm
01/01/2020, 23:02 - Okiki Bello: BB can't be here at the moment. He is not feeling that strong!
01/01/2020, 23:02 - Timi: @BB good ebening
01/01/2020, 23:02 - Korede: He is still celebrating new year.
01/01/2020, 23:02 - SUG: Guendouzi is not part of it at all
01/01/2020, 23:02 - SUG: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
01/01/2020, 23:02 - Timi: @2348165314296
01/01/2020, 23:03 - Okiki Bello: I wouldn't say that! I would rather say he is getting to know what his players can do!
01/01/2020, 23:03 - Okiki Bello: And mentally motivating them.
01/01/2020, 23:03 - Timi: Yea
01/01/2020, 23:04 - Okiki Bello: Guendouzi and Xhaka can work.. But it would mean more work for Xhaka because Guendouzi can't make tackles
01/01/2020, 23:04 - SUG: He understand xhaka well
01/01/2020, 23:04 - SUG: Now he is calling nketia back from load
01/01/2020, 23:04 - Okiki Bello: They are similar!
01/01/2020, 23:05 - SUG: Just simple
01/01/2020, 23:05 - Oluwatobi K: Leeds were not using him as expected, that was why.

They'll still probably loan him to another club with better playing time
01/01/2020, 23:05 - Oluwatobi K: Emily Smith Rowe might also go on loan.
01/01/2020, 23:06 - SUG: I always beat this united
01/01/2020, 23:06 - Oluwatobi K: I think mavropanos should go on loan too, but this recent defence injury is a problem.
01/01/2020, 23:06 - Okiki Bello: Holding is back!
01/01/2020, 23:07 - SUG: Make that one go abeg
01/01/2020, 23:07 - SUG: For emirate ooo
EPL
01/01/2020, 23:07 - SUG: I flog him 2-0 last year
01/01/2020, 23:07 - Okiki Bello: No be pride, sha!
01/01/2020, 23:07 - Oluwatobi K: Btw, how will Ceballos play like this, Ozil is untouchable at the moment o..🙂
01/01/2020, 23:08 - Okiki Bello: It's either Arsenal sign a defensive midfielder or an attacking midfielder.
01/01/2020, 23:08 - SUG: I flog am 2-0 last season
01/01/2020, 23:08 - Okiki Bello: But a DM is important
01/01/2020, 23:08 - Okiki Bello: And they haven't beaten us in five encounters!
01/01/2020, 23:09 - Oluwatobi K: That is if Xhaka leaves, else CB is Importanter
01/01/2020, 23:09 - Okiki Bello: Rowe is actually a good player! If Ozil mentors him, he might turn out well.
01/01/2020, 23:10 - Okiki Bello: We have four CBs.
01/01/2020, 23:10 - Okiki Bello: Just one DM!
01/01/2020, 23:10 - SUG: 😌😌😌
01/01/2020, 23:10 - Okiki Bello: I don't think Xhaka is leaving anytime soon!
01/01/2020, 23:10 - Oluwatobi K: I hope so
01/01/2020, 23:10 - Okiki Bello: Please! Ceballos, Guendouzi aren't DMs !
01/01/2020, 23:11 - Okiki Bello: Torreira is more of box to box midfielder !
01/01/2020, 23:11 - Oluwatobi K: Who doesn't know that?
01/01/2020, 23:11 - Oluwatobi K: He is a DM sir...
01/01/2020, 23:11 - Okiki Bello: Exactly! More reason why Arsenal needs to sign a DM!
01/01/2020, 23:12 - Okiki Bello: But Emery has changed his mentality!
01/01/2020, 23:12 - Okiki Bello: And again he gets cheated because of height!
01/01/2020, 23:12 - Oluwatobi K: Arteta is playing him in the right position and he is doing well.
01/01/2020, 23:12 - Okiki Bello: Don't get me wrong, there are occasions where he uses it to his advantage.. But na PL we dey!
01/01/2020, 23:13 - Okiki Bello: Na dem ride am.
01/01/2020, 23:13 - Okiki Bello: Dem dey ride am*
01/01/2020, 23:13 - Oluwatobi K: True
01/01/2020, 23:13 - SUG: Good CB jare
01/01/2020, 23:13 - Oluwatobi K: Abi o
01/01/2020, 23:13 - Okiki Bello: Torreira is always in front whenever we are attacking
01/01/2020, 23:14 - Okiki Bello: But Xhaka no dey comot that back.
01/01/2020, 23:14 - Korede: You guys need a Fernandinho or Fabinho or Casemiro.
01/01/2020, 23:15 - Korede: But Xhaka does well too.
01/01/2020, 23:15 - Korede: Wait. These are all Brazilians. 😆
01/01/2020, 23:15 - Okiki Bello: I am not saying he isn't doing well.. He would need a replacement too
01/01/2020, 23:16 - Okiki Bello: Are you just knowing that they have the best DMs?
01/01/2020, 23:16 - Okiki Bello: Allan in Napoli too!
01/01/2020, 23:16 - Korede: True.
01/01/2020, 23:16 - Oluwatobi K: Yes.. because Xhaka is at the back.. Torriera wins tackle back for us when  opposition is transitioning.
01/01/2020, 23:17 - Okiki Bello: Yes.. It would work sha with Xhaka. It might not work with another midfielder in the Arsenal squad
01/01/2020, 23:19 - Okiki Bello: Same thing Kante use to do!
01/01/2020, 23:19 - Okiki Bello: And you know Kante is a box to box midfielder!?

08/01/2020, 09:24 - Korede: Israel will just end the fight. 😂
08/01/2020, 09:24 - SUG: Yes now
08/01/2020, 09:25 - SUG: That will be the end of it
08/01/2020, 09:25 - Korede: They will use it as excuse to wipe out the middle east. 😂😂😂
08/01/2020, 09:25 - Ayodele Adewale: O serious
08/01/2020, 09:26 - Korede: I'm serious oooo. 😂 
You can't be here analyzing this thing for us. The US needs you.
08/01/2020, 09:26 - SUG: 😂😂
08/01/2020, 09:26 - Korede: Nigeria has no need for you. We won't even know where to start from if this fight reach here.
08/01/2020, 09:29 - Okiki Bello: Attacks on Israel would make Israel crush them..
08/01/2020, 09:30 - Korede: 💯
08/01/2020, 09:31 - Okiki Bello: I believe the reason why US government loves Israel is mainly because they can't attack them.. Isreal is much more stronger in mass destructive weapon than US.

So, if you can defeat them, make em your friend.
08/01/2020, 09:32 - Ayodele Adewale: The Jews more or less built the US
08/01/2020, 09:33 - Okiki Bello: Well, why i said i believe!
08/01/2020, 09:34 - Okiki Bello: Is there a good relationship between Putin and Trump?
08/01/2020, 09:34 - Korede: Israel as far as I am concerned and the world is concerned are the baddest.
08/01/2020, 09:34 - Korede: Allegedly
08/01/2020, 09:35 - Korede: Anyways let's see how this goes.
08/01/2020, 09:36 - Korede: So far it is helping Nigeria. 'Cos oil prices are up!
08/01/2020, 09:37 - Ayodele Adewale: But subsidy is also rising
08/01/2020, 09:37 - Okiki Bello: Do you think we have oil?
08/01/2020, 09:38 - Okiki Bello: Oil is being imported into Nigeria, i believe.

Is that not the reason why we are subsidizing the price!
08/01/2020, 09:38 - Ayodele Adewale: Erm 
Nope
08/01/2020, 09:40 - Ayodele Adewale: We export oil
And import the refined products cause our refineries are dead
But at the cost fuel is imported the average Nigeria can't afford it so the govt pays part of the cost hence subsidy
08/01/2020, 09:40 - Enny J: Very soon we will stop subsidizing after the completion of dangote refinery

We subsidize because of the fee that is used in bringing the oil into the country

After all the excise duty and the rest, it is hard for the marketers to sell at the #145

So government is standing in on their behalf
08/01/2020, 09:41 - Okiki Bello: 🤐
08/01/2020, 09:41 - Okiki Bello: Thank you! I for go talk nonsense outside
08/01/2020, 09:41 - Okiki Bello: But i was right that we import fuel
08/01/2020, 09:43 - Kolade FUOYE: Amen sir
08/01/2020, 09:43 - Korede: Dude. No!
08/01/2020, 09:43 - Korede: We produce 1.5m barrels daily.

08/01/2020, 10:12 - Orisa: Lol
08/01/2020, 10:14 - Korede: Australia's deadly fires have been fuelled by a combination of extreme heat, prolonged drought and strong winds. The country is in the grip of a heatwave, with record-breaking temperatures over the last three months.

Basically climate change.
08/01/2020, 10:14 - Ayodele Adewale: Couldn't have said better myself

10/01/2020, 21:46 - Orisa: Lol
10/01/2020, 21:52 - SUG: 😒😒
11/01/2020, 07:21 - Prince: <Media omitted>
11/01/2020, 14:55 - Korede: Aubameyang red card. 😭
His face breaks my heart. 💔😢
11/01/2020, 14:56 - Ayodele Adewale: Or maybe it's because he is in your FPL team
11/01/2020, 14:56 - Korede: Var ehn...
11/01/2020, 14:56 - Okiki Bello: I swear.. VAR is just spoiling games
11/01/2020, 14:56 - Korede: And that too. 😭😭😭
11/01/2020, 14:56 - Ayodele Adewale: Wetin happen
11/01/2020, 14:57 - Korede: It was probably worth it. He hurt the player.
11/01/2020, 14:57 - Okiki Bello: REF has given yellow card.. So be it!
11/01/2020, 14:57 - Okiki Bello: This game is fucked already!
11/01/2020, 14:57 - Korede: Relax.
11/01/2020, 14:57 - Korede: This VAR can work in your favour too. Be Calm.
11/01/2020, 14:58 - Korede: Anyways, Vardy it is up to you.
11/01/2020, 14:58 - Ayodele Adewale: This is not an excuse if the red card is right though
11/01/2020, 14:58 - Okiki Bello: The ref has been partial since the beginning of the match. Crystal Palace players have been aggressive. They even injured Torreira due to tackles.. And the ref is just giving them the first yellow card since
11/01/2020, 14:59 - Ayodele Adewale: As far they didn't break the rules then there's pretty nothing you can do but complain
11/01/2020, 15:00 - Okiki Bello: When Jorginho was on yellow card and pulled down Guendouzi in Arsenal match vs Chelsea. Why didn't VAR come up with possible foul play!! Fuck VAR, mehn
11/01/2020, 15:00 - Ayodele Adewale: I am not a fan of VAR
11/01/2020, 15:00 - Okiki Bello: Until the whole thing comes against you
11/01/2020, 15:00 - Ayodele Adewale: But when it's right it's right
11/01/2020, 15:00 - Okiki Bello: That's how they ruled out West Ham's goal yesterday!
11/01/2020, 15:01 - Ayodele Adewale: And you know this 
You are just pained it didn't favour you today
11/01/2020, 15:01 - Ayodele Adewale: Was it offside or not
11/01/2020, 15:01 - Korede: Okiki relax. No vex. Una go still win.
11/01/2020, 15:02 - Okiki Bello: It wasn't even offside. They claimed handball in the build-up to the goal..
11/01/2020, 15:02 - Ayodele Adewale: Yeah handball
11/01/2020, 15:02 - Ayodele Adewale: It was handball na
11/01/2020, 15:02 - Okiki Bello: The opposition player nodded the ball into Declan Rice hand. Declan Rice was on air oo..
11/01/2020, 15:03 - Ayodele Adewale: A lot of you don't know this but there has been a rule change concerning handball for attacking teams
11/01/2020, 15:03 - Okiki Bello: Win what?? With red card! Against Crystal Palace that likes counter.
11/01/2020, 15:03 - Korede: As long as the ball touched an arm in the build up to a goal, it is handball. Ball to hand or not. Check the rules mate. 
It is annoying but that's how it ism
11/01/2020, 15:04 - Ayodele Adewale: Once it strikes the hand of a player on the attacking team whether intentional or not whether the hand was in a natural position or not
11/01/2020, 15:04 - Korede: I'm more of an Arsenal fan than you. 🙄
11/01/2020, 15:04 - Ayodele Adewale: The goal is not awarded but handball is given
11/01/2020, 15:05 - Ayodele Adewale: So Okiki handball was the right call yesterday 
VAR got it spot on
11/01/2020, 15:05 - Korede: Thank you. EPL stated those rules when they implemented VAR this season. I thought we all saw this.
11/01/2020, 15:05 - Ayodele Adewale: Uwc
11/01/2020, 15:06 - Okiki Bello: You people should goan watch the highlight.. Sheffield United vs West Ham
11/01/2020, 15:07 - Ayodele Adewale: Okiki you yourself gave us the only piece of relevant information 
The ball struck the hand of a player in the attacking team
11/01/2020, 15:07 - Ayodele Adewale: It's handball 
New rule
11/01/2020, 15:08 - Okiki Bello: The ref has been partial since

I wish you guys are watching this game
11/01/2020, 15:08 - Korede: I am.
11/01/2020, 15:08 - Ayodele Adewale: I think it was Eni that shared the pictures of the rules changes just before the season started
11/01/2020, 15:08 - Korede: Period.
11/01/2020, 15:08 - Korede: Yes ooo. It was even everywhere

11/01/2020, 15:12 - Ayodele Adewale: Leave Okiki abeg
11/01/2020, 15:12 - Okiki Bello: I still don't understand why Lacazette can't finish this
11/01/2020, 15:12 - Okiki Bello: Wey i don leave una since!
11/01/2020, 15:13 - Ayodele Adewale: United vs Arsenal first leg
The ref and linesman cancelled their equaliser and awarded offside
VAR stepped in and awarded the goal
11/01/2020, 15:13 - Ayodele Adewale: He didn't cry about VAR then
11/01/2020, 15:15 - Okiki Bello: My own point is.. VAR shouldn't make the final decision. Ref should be able to watch the highlight on TV before making decisions!
11/01/2020, 15:16 - Okiki Bello: That's how it is being used in La liga and and how it was used in the world cup!
11/01/2020, 15:16 - Okiki Bello: Even FA!
11/01/2020, 15:17 - Ayodele Adewale: The red card was the right call
The handball was the right call
The goal awarded to you against us was the right call
11/01/2020, 15:18 - Okiki Bello: Are you watching the game?
11/01/2020, 17:31 - Okiki Bello: E be like say Vardy no wan dedicate goal to him newly born baby abi?

U think if there was another platform to serve with better pay I will do NYSC tueeeh
18/01/2020, 08:57 - Korede: I think those that use degrees to enter. Not necessarily passing through the recruit stage. See ehn you people there's Google. Use it.
18/01/2020, 08:58 - Korede: I sha know that From captain level upward, you earn a nice pay. Not sure about the Lieutenants.
18/01/2020, 08:59 - Korede: I don't have a figure to give you sha. And I don't want to ask.
18/01/2020, 08:59 - Korede: Una no go kuku join army.

30/01/2020, 00:38 - Korede: God has better things to do than to help a club that if they were the only ones in the league, they'd still drop points.
30/01/2020, 07:25 - SUG: The only thing I can do is to remove u

30/01/2020, 12:28 - Korede: This is accurate.
30/01/2020, 12:29 - Korede: Be sure that Mustafi will cost his side goals and David Luiz will collect red card on the other side. 
Pathetic people.
30/01/2020, 12:30 - Kolade FUOYE: 😅
30/01/2020, 12:54 - Ayodele Adewale: And Lacazete will miss the last chance of the game
30/01/2020, 12:55 - Korede: 😆
30/01/2020, 14:15 - Okiki Bello: Coming from a fan whose team couldn't finish off man city due to inability of players to create chances and score chances

30/01/2020, 14:32 - Ayodele Adewale: Just cause we didnt beat you this season you are suffering amnesia

31/01/2020, 18:46 - Korede: Alonso doesn't know how to Mark. 
Kola (olawuwo) is just a body builder 
Mustafi looks like the China version or Prince Harry, plays like him too.

01/02/2020, 11:02 - Okiki Bello: Lingard has no goal or assist with worst stats in the league, you are still paying him.

01/02/2020, 11:08 - Okiki Bello: The league is different to other leagues. He is still learning!
01/02/2020, 11:08 - Ayodele Adewale: If you are talking about Greenwood who is younger than him let me just remind you he has more goals
01/02/2020, 11:08 - Okiki Bello: If he doesn't now perform next season...we would talk
01/02/2020, 11:09 - Okiki Bello: Greenwood.. No.. That one should be compared with our Martinelli
01/02/2020, 11:09 - Okiki Bello: I am talking about Lingard!
01/02/2020, 11:09 - Ayodele Adewale: But please don't ever compare Pepe's first season to that of Firmino or CR7 ever again
01/02/2020, 11:10 - Okiki Bello: We don't need to give Martinelli penalty to Reach 10 goals
01/02/2020, 11:10 - Ayodele Adewale: You are the one tagging him as the next big thing oh

01/02/2020, 11:12 - Okiki Bello: Whenever Greenwood scores, your fans are always calling out Martinelli..
01/02/2020, 11:12 - Ayodele Adewale: If it's like that then every person that engages in banter is racist
01/02/2020, 11:13 - Ayodele Adewale: As expected

04/02/2020, 09:23 - SUG: I think you are already given us your opinion 😏
04/02/2020, 09:24 - Ayodele Adewale: Thor actually is stronger
04/02/2020, 09:25 - Ayodele Adewale: Thor also almost killed Thanos remember
04/02/2020, 09:26 - Oye: Thor is stronger in the movies but scarlet witch as a character is stronger.
04/02/2020, 09:26 - Ayodele Adewale: Who have been successful if had gone for the head
04/02/2020, 09:26 - Babayomi: Lol, felt Thor was stronger too bcos he is a god and  the extent of his powers is not yet fully known
04/02/2020, 09:27 - Ayodele Adewale: I saw a ranking once that put Thor ahead of her
04/02/2020, 09:28 - Oye: Most of the rankings are based on a few peoples opinion... Scarlet witch in comics is super strong and her power is magic
04/02/2020, 09:29 - Ayodele Adewale: Used to have it self but I think I have deleted it
04/02/2020, 09:29 - Ayodele Adewale: They are both silly strong sha
04/02/2020, 09:29 - Babayomi: That's true
04/02/2020, 09:30 - Ayodele Adewale: Barman vs Captain America
04/02/2020, 09:30 - Ayodele Adewale: I vote batman

04/02/2020, 09:31 - Babayomi: They're actually kinda similar. Batman shud prevail bcos of his use of tech though
04/02/2020, 09:31 - Ayodele Adewale: Even hand to hand batman will beat captain
04/02/2020, 09:32 - Ayodele Adewale: People take batman for granted
04/02/2020, 09:33 - Oye: This is hard though... Because captain has super soldier serum
04/02/2020, 09:34 - Ayodele Adewale: There's actually an official comic and batman won
04/02/2020, 09:34 - Oye: But batman has trained in various forms of martial art
04/02/2020, 09:34 - Ayodele Adewale: If not all
04/02/2020, 09:34 - Ayodele Adewale: He beat superman
04/02/2020, 09:34 - Oye: 😂
04/02/2020, 09:34 - Oye: With kryptonite
04/02/2020, 09:35 - Oye: Batman can beat everyone, if he prepares
04/02/2020, 09:35 - SUG: 👍🏽👍🏽
04/02/2020, 09:35 - SUG: I like this clause

04/02/2020, 09:36 - Ayodele Adewale: Flashpoint paradox

04/02/2020, 09:37 - SUG: I dont think everyone
04/02/2020, 09:37 - Ayodele Adewale: Do you read comics?
04/02/2020, 09:38 - SUG: Nope

Though I believe that guy is brilliant
04/02/2020, 09:38 - SUG: Wise and patient
04/02/2020, 09:38 - SUG: Facing captain will be difficult
04/02/2020, 09:38 - Ayodele Adewale: Then don't argue when we tell you batman has a plan for every member of the justice league
04/02/2020, 09:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Doesn't mean he won't win
04/02/2020, 09:39 - Oye: Justice League: Doom https://g.co/kgs/9yt78L
04/02/2020, 09:39 - SUG: I agreed actually
04/02/2020, 09:40 - Ayodele Adewale: Why did you now say this
04/02/2020, 09:40 - Ayodele Adewale: Thanks Oye
04/02/2020, 09:41 - SUG: Thanks man
04/02/2020, 09:41 - SUG: What could wonder woman weak point be ??
04/02/2020, 09:41 - Ayodele Adewale: Batman was crazy enough to put his own weakness in it
04/02/2020, 09:41 - SUG: Wow
04/02/2020, 09:42 - Ayodele Adewale: Can't remember 
Just check the link Oye dropped
04/02/2020, 09:43 - Oye: It was a drug to make her see everyone as her opponent... Fight till she can't move again
04/02/2020, 09:45 - Oye: Flash was run... If you stop running a bomb on your wrist will explode
04/02/2020, 09:45 - Oye: I don't remember the rest
04/02/2020, 09:47 - Ayodele Adewale: Superman 
A bullet to heart with cryptonite
04/02/2020, 09:48 - Ayodele Adewale: Martian was fire
04/02/2020, 09:53 - Oluwatobi K: Bobheartadeshola

04/02/2020, 13:18 - Ayodele Adewale: 👍🏻
04/02/2020, 18:39 - Okiki Bello: I downloaded one yesterday. The Umbrella Academy. Quite Interesting. About time travel and apocalypse and superheroes.

For me it's 4/5
06/02/2020, 23:24 - Korede: Barcelona just dey wash
06/02/2020, 23:24 - Korede: Madrid is normal.
06/02/2020, 23:29 - Enny J: Heard Messi and abidal not in good terms
06/02/2020, 23:30 - Enny J: And it seems the board are not in support of Messi
06/02/2020, 23:40 - Korede: Make hin come EPL jaare. 🌝
06/02/2020, 23:51 - Enny J: Na him know sha
06/02/2020, 23:52 - Oluwatobi K: Seems it's the other way around o..
06/02/2020, 23:52 - Enny J: I don't think so
06/02/2020, 23:53 - Enny J: Supersport still talked about it
06/02/2020, 23:53 - Oluwatobi K: Messi publicly attacked abidal's comment towards the team.

Fast forward the board summons a meeting with abidal over the issue.
06/02/2020, 23:54 - Oluwatobi K: Outcome of the meeting as been rumours tho..
06/02/2020, 23:54 - Enny J: Yeah, but they are in support of abidal
06/02/2020, 23:54 - Enny J: Because Messi is presently having problem with the board
06/02/2020, 23:55 - Enny J: And there are rumors that e might leave also
06/02/2020, 23:55 - Enny J: But they are all rumors
06/02/2020, 23:55 - SUG: Is not really because of that
06/02/2020, 23:55 - SUG: Not the abidal issue
06/02/2020, 23:55 - Oluwatobi K: Yea
06/02/2020, 23:56 - Enny J: Okay, but brought about his issue with the board
06/02/2020, 23:56 - Enny J: I will come back tomorrow with the right source
06/02/2020, 23:56 - Enny J: Let me watch small Supersport 🌚🤓
07/02/2020, 07:10 - Okiki Bello: Lmao.. Eniola, in this kind of issue, the board would always back Messi. Always!!!
07/02/2020, 07:10 - Okiki Bello: All this news are just rumors. At the end, it might be Abidal that might resign.
07/02/2020, 07:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Abidal is a member of the Barca staff oh
07/02/2020, 07:11 - Okiki Bello: Technical director!
07/02/2020, 07:11 - Ayodele Adewale: And Messi and the board are not exactly on good terms
07/02/2020, 07:11 - Ayodele Adewale: They will find a way of settling it with both of them
07/02/2020, 07:12 - Okiki Bello: They can't let him go. They know if he goes, they would become like Manchester United!
07/02/2020, 07:16 - Enny J: Who be this goat?
UNA no fit talk without mentioning Manchester united? Ahan
07/02/2020, 07:16 - Ayodele Adewale: Yeah because arsenal is prime Barca, Real, Bayern, PSG and Juve all rolled up into one team
07/02/2020, 07:16 - Orisa: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
07/02/2020, 07:16 - Enny J: Abi o
I tire for the guy
07/02/2020, 07:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Don't mind him that what happens when someone that should have been a legend for them had to leave to a rival team to win the premier league
07/02/2020, 07:18 - Okiki Bello: No insult to Manchester United
07/02/2020, 07:18 - Enny J: <Media omitted>

07/02/2020, 07:21 - SUG: 😂😂😂
07/02/2020, 07:21 - Okiki Bello: What i am trying to say is, without Messi .. Barca is nothing
07/02/2020, 07:21 - Orisa: No be only jehova witness
07/02/2020, 07:21 - Okiki Bello: It's like you don't know how we roll here
07/02/2020, 07:21 - Okiki Bello: We resume work 10am or 11

07/02/2020, 07:22 - Okiki Bello: I go still sleep round 2 wake up for 9:30
07/02/2020, 07:22 - Orisa: Low budget emir 

A king himself
07/02/2020, 07:22 - SUG: You self hear wetin u dey talk
07/02/2020, 07:24 - SUG: If I should explain that ehn
07/02/2020, 07:24 - Orisa: Ma binu so gbo
07/02/2020, 07:24 - SUG: Orie gbale
07/02/2020, 07:25 - SUG: 😂😂😂
07/02/2020, 07:25 - Orisa: Anh ah
07/02/2020, 07:25 - Orisa: Wah did I do
07/02/2020, 07:25 - Okiki Bello: I didn't say Manchester united are nothing
07/02/2020, 07:26 - Okiki Bello: It's like Ola wants to contend with BB this morning
07/02/2020, 07:26 - Okiki Bello: Abi.. Ma binu!
07/02/2020, 07:28 - Ayodele Adewale: Not true
07/02/2020, 07:28 - SUG: How
07/02/2020, 07:28 - SUG: Explain
07/02/2020, 07:29 - Ayodele Adewale: Both of you can't even say that
07/02/2020, 07:30 - Ayodele Adewale: Because before Messi they won titles
07/02/2020, 07:30 - SUG: I was about correcting him self 

That you people now have ighalo 

So all those rubbish he was saying is not part of it
07/02/2020, 07:31 - Ayodele Adewale: After him tell will win something
07/02/2020, 07:31 - Ayodele Adewale: Have you ever heard of let sleeping dogs lie
07/02/2020, 07:32 - SUG: Guy na
07/02/2020, 07:32 - SUG: We all know it will always be soldier go soldier come
07/02/2020, 07:33 - Okiki Bello: Why i am even using Nothing.
07/02/2020, 07:34 - Okiki Bello: Messi is a phenomenon. If he goes, he is not replaceable. They can only try! They can't find a replacement for him. So, Barcelona would lose those matches Messi came in to save them
07/02/2020, 07:38 - SUG: Someone cannot even support you again
07/02/2020, 07:41 - SUG: We are talking of world class area 

Since ronaldo left Manchester, Manchester won something, but they have not been phenomena across Europe
07/02/2020, 07:45 - Okiki Bello: What part of let sleeping dog lie don't you understand.
07/02/2020, 07:48 - Ayodele Adewale: You can never exactly replace a player
07/02/2020, 07:50 - Ayodele Adewale: We won at least two premier league titles 
Made it to a champ league final losing to Barca led Messi
Etc
That's not an overly bad return if you ask me
07/02/2020, 07:51 - Ayodele Adewale: And Barca will most probably do better considering they are in La Liga and thier board and owners are not as inept as United's
07/02/2020, 07:51 - SUG: U miss it guy
07/02/2020, 07:52 - Ayodele Adewale: Nope
07/02/2020, 07:53 - Ayodele Adewale: Both Messi and CR 7 are phenoms no doubt
07/02/2020, 07:53 - Ayodele Adewale: They don't get replaced
07/02/2020, 07:53 - SUG: We are talking about a world class player here 

Madrid felt ronaldo effect
07/02/2020, 07:53 - Ayodele Adewale: I didn't say Barca won't feel it
07/02/2020, 07:53 - Ayodele Adewale: You are the one getting me wrong
07/02/2020, 07:54 - SUG: It will take time to have guys like that in your team
07/02/2020, 07:54 - SUG: Correct
07/02/2020, 07:54 - Ayodele Adewale: What I am saying is that they won't suddenly start playing like a relegation team
07/02/2020, 07:54 - SUG: 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
07/02/2020, 07:54 - SUG: At all
07/02/2020, 07:55 - Ayodele Adewale: There was a Pele Dinho R9 Kaka
Etc
07/02/2020, 07:57 - Ayodele Adewale: And people wondered if they could ever be replaced

07/02/2020, 11:56 - Korede: See this one?? 🤦🏾‍♂
07/02/2020, 11:57 - Orisa: Lol
07/02/2020, 11:58 - Korede: Quick Maths. 💁🏾‍♂
07/02/2020, 11:58 - Orisa: Ma binu
07/02/2020, 11:59 - Orisa: My answer no b whole number na y I wan confirm
07/02/2020, 12:00 - Ayodele Adewale: Yeah
07/02/2020, 12:01 - Olisa: This one that 97% will fail it, I don't understand again😂
07/02/2020, 12:01 - Olisa: It should be √28 I guess
07/02/2020, 12:02 - Ayodele Adewale: I got this at first
07/02/2020, 12:02 - Orisa: Samething I got
07/02/2020, 12:02 - Olisa: Sorry 10😅😅
07/02/2020, 12:02 - Ayodele Adewale: But they my maths was wrong
07/02/2020, 12:02 - Ayodele Adewale: Correct answer
07/02/2020, 12:02 - Ayodele Adewale: *then
07/02/2020, 12:03 - Ayodele Adewale: 64+36
07/02/2020, 12:03 - Orisa: Ohhhh
07/02/2020, 12:03 - Olisa: That minus
07/02/2020, 12:03 - Olisa: Don't worry, we have joined the 97%
07/02/2020, 12:03 - Olisa: 😂
07/02/2020, 12:03 - Ayodele Adewale: Exactly 
I also forgot to change the sign the first I solved
07/02/2020, 12:04 - Korede: Shame on you ooo.
07/02/2020, 12:04 - Orisa: I know the short cut toward d getting 10 

But what's the theory behind it abeg
07/02/2020, 12:04 - Ayodele Adewale: Just square both sides
07/02/2020, 12:04 - Orisa: Ohhhh
07/02/2020, 12:04 - Orisa: Have seen it
07/02/2020, 12:04 - Ayodele Adewale: It will remove the squreroot
07/02/2020, 12:04 - Orisa: The part of 64-36
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Ayodele Adewale: Make x subject
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Orisa: Instead of 64+36
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Olisa: Lol
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Orisa: I got all the part
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Orisa: Lol
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Ayodele Adewale: Once minus crosses the equality sign it changes to plus
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Orisa: Y exactly did our mind skips this basic stuff
07/02/2020, 12:06 - Ayodele Adewale: Must people will fail it because instead of writing it out they solve it in thier heads
07/02/2020, 12:06 - Ayodele Adewale: Which is what three of us did
07/02/2020, 12:06 - Korede: 😂 I know right.
07/02/2020, 12:07 - Ayodele Adewale: But the thing with maths is that when you don't get a whole number as your answer in some equations 
You tend to try and solve again
07/02/2020, 12:07 - Orisa: Funny enough I actually wrote it down

But I had the picture in my head already
07/02/2020, 12:07 - Ayodele Adewale: Which is what we did and realised our error with the signs
07/02/2020, 12:07 - Olisa: @2348103679562 ,of all the fine fine pictures Enny has been posting, it is the one that he looks like someone suffering that you could upload abi. It is well with you o
07/02/2020, 12:08 - Korede: 😂 😂 😂 I am doing throwback na.
07/02/2020, 12:08 - Orisa: Wey e b lyk refugee
07/02/2020, 12:09 - Olisa: Or prisoners sef.. Korede you no try o
07/02/2020, 12:09 - Ayodele Adewale: You wrote only after solving in your head
So you weren't actually solving when writing 
You were just coping out a mental solution
07/02/2020, 12:09 - Orisa: Na so Korede dey do
07/02/2020, 12:09 - Orisa: 🙈🙈🙈😁

08/02/2020, 04:38 - Ayodele Adewale: The answer is 10
08/02/2020, 04:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Square both side
08/02/2020, 04:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Make x the subject
08/02/2020, 04:39 - Okiki Bello: You would square both side.
08/02/2020, 04:39 - Okiki Bello: 36+64 gives you 100
08/02/2020, 04:40 - Okiki Bello: Find the square root and your answer is 10!
08/02/2020, 04:40 - Ayodele Adewale: Squaring boths sides turns the equation to x2-36=64
×2=64+36
×2=100
Squreroot of both sides
X=10
08/02/2020, 04:44 - Prince: Hmmm

14/02/2020, 14:02 - Oye: Another way to do this kind of question is assume your 3rd number is 100. 
Since it's all on percentage it will make finding the solution easier of you are trying to work fast. And since it's objective you don't need to show workings
14/02/2020, 20:18 - Enny J: Banned how? They won't play champions league?
14/02/2020, 20:19 - Enny J: Thank you jesus

16/02/2020, 22:23 - Prof Makinwa: X+18=y

You pick option A first

Daughter 9
Mother 9+18 = 27

After 9 years
Daughter 18
Mother 27+9 = 36
16/02/2020, 22:25 - Enny J: Option B
16/02/2020, 22:26 - Enny J: Long method, you will not solve 10 if you go through this way
16/02/2020, 22:27 - Ayodele Adewale: Not true
16/02/2020, 22:27 - Enny J: How do you want to solve this in 30/35 seconds

16/02/2020, 22:30 - Enny J: Nobody is doing tumbo tumbo
There are a lot of way to beat the conventional method of solving
The conventional method is slower

17/02/2020, 22:15 - Ayodele Adewale: You didn't see the push
17/02/2020, 22:15 - Ayodele Adewale: Or a push is not a foul again
17/02/2020, 22:16 - Okiki Bello: For once, be truthful, Fred pushed Azpi into Williams, na
17/02/2020, 22:16 - Ayodele Adewale: That's not what happened
17/02/2020, 22:16 - Ayodele Adewale: You are watching back of T.V.
17/02/2020, 22:16 - Ayodele Adewale: And don't insinuate I am lying next time
17/02/2020, 22:17 - Okiki Bello: OK
17/02/2020, 22:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Something the commentator even said that the push wasn't necessary
17/02/2020, 22:29 - Okiki Bello: That Maguire tackle on Batshuayi is similar to what got Son a red card against Chelsea!
But na back of TV i dey watch
17/02/2020, 22:30 - Ayodele Adewale: This is not what we were talking about
17/02/2020, 22:30 - Jb Rama: Things like this didn't start today na
17/02/2020, 22:31 - Ayodele Adewale: God bless Bailey

17/02/2020, 22:32 - Okiki Bello: Either this match or the next
17/02/2020, 22:33 - Okiki Bello: I do have a feeling, Inter would play Manchester in Europa. If you know, you know
17/02/2020, 22:33 - Ayodele Adewale: Mr feeler
17/02/2020, 22:34 - Okiki Bello: Lukaku and Young would do it for the culture
17/02/2020, 22:35 - Okiki Bello: Giroud!

17/02/2020, 22:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol
17/02/2020, 22:41 - Okiki Bello: Lampard is learning sha. For me, Giroud over Batshuayi
17/02/2020, 22:41 - Ayodele Adewale: I agree 
He should have started Giroud
17/02/2020, 22:42 - Okiki Bello: He didn't even make the substitution mistakes he made against Arsenal here
17/02/2020, 22:43 - Ayodele Adewale: The injuries didn't let him
17/02/2020, 22:44 - Okiki Bello: Lmao. So you are saying he would have made the substitution mistakes he made against Arsenal
17/02/2020, 22:44 - Ayodele Adewale: He might have
17/02/2020, 22:45 - Ayodele Adewale: His substitutions have never exactly been top notch
17/02/2020, 22:46 - Oluwatobi K: This life Sha... Man Utd that I flogged properly is now doing Chelsea anyhow. 

Football ehn.  😅
17/02/2020, 22:46 - Okiki Bello: Allow me humour them, "They didn't have a summer transfer window"
17/02/2020, 22:47 - Okiki Bello: That should have been my signout message

17/02/2020, 22:57 - SUG: Must Manchester united defeat Chelsea
17/02/2020, 22:57 - Okiki Bello: What are you saying?

17/02/2020, 23:16 - Ayodele Adewale: https://twitter.com/Yemihazan/status/1229526448639225857?s=08

18/02/2020, 09:59 - Babayomi: Lol...e dey happen
18/02/2020, 12:14 - Ayodele Adewale: Darksied vs Thanos 
Who wins
18/02/2020, 12:14 - Korede: Darkseid. For me sha.
18/02/2020, 12:15 - Ayodele Adewale: Reason
18/02/2020, 12:18 - Korede: His full power is unknown. 
We know Thanos is extraordinarily crazy. Especially with the Infinity stones...but what else does Thanos have, apart from the physicality. 
Maybe the stones might give him an edge though 💁🏾‍♂
18/02/2020, 12:20 - Ayodele Adewale: Well the stones might not work on darkseid
18/02/2020, 12:21 - Ayodele Adewale: For the fact that he has never manifested his real form
18/02/2020, 12:23 - Ayodele Adewale: So basically every time he fights on earth he uses an Avatar
18/02/2020, 12:23 - Ayodele Adewale: So how do the stones work on someone that it's actually there
18/02/2020, 12:24 - Ayodele Adewale: Is not
18/02/2020, 12:25 - Korede: But if it is just physical strength, pound for pound, Darkseid has fought superman and beaten the shit out of him...So 💁🏾‍♂
18/02/2020, 12:26 - Korede: We are in Agreement my brother.
18/02/2020, 12:26 - Ayodele Adewale: I know
18/02/2020, 12:26 - Korede: DC usually know how to Exaggerate their characters powers. Namely Superman and Darkseid. 😆
18/02/2020, 12:27 - Ayodele Adewale: Was just saying even at full powers
Thanos might not be a match for him
18/02/2020, 12:27 - Korede: Darkseid is in a world of his own. His powers are unknown, he seldom does anything himself and still causes havoc.
18/02/2020, 12:27 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol
18/02/2020, 12:28 - Korede: He will not. But as par Thanos is Marvel's strongest villain, he will last 1 hour max.
18/02/2020, 12:28 - Ayodele Adewale: But with the right plan superman can be taken down
18/02/2020, 12:29 - Ayodele Adewale: Out of respect to him 
Let's agree
18/02/2020, 12:29 - Korede: And Darkseid always comes up with that plan but you know the good guys must always win.
18/02/2020, 12:29 - Korede: 😂 yes ooo.
18/02/2020, 12:29 - Korede: I don't even know how DC will portray Darkseid because he is just too much.
18/02/2020, 12:30 - Korede: The guy kidnapped supes cousin and they still had to beg to get her back. And thanks to Batman's shady tricks.
18/02/2020, 12:31 - Ayodele Adewale: No mind dem
18/02/2020, 12:31 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol Darkseid is just extra
18/02/2020, 12:32 - Korede: Honestly not all of us are into Happy endings. 💁🏾‍♂
18/02/2020, 12:32 - Korede: Very.
18/02/2020, 12:32 - Ayodele Adewale: Wonder why DC created a super villain we can never actually see in full strength or his full form
18/02/2020, 12:33 - Korede: Please help me ask them ooo. 😭
18/02/2020, 12:35 - Ayodele Adewale: Makes me think he only attacks when he feels bored and wants to play on earth
18/02/2020, 12:42 - Korede: I swear. 😂
18/02/2020, 12:44 - Ayodele Adewale: Remember the cap and batman argument
18/02/2020, 12:44 - Ayodele Adewale: So peeps were saying they wouldn't take bat serious because he is always after joker
18/02/2020, 12:45 - Ayodele Adewale: But I think even Cap would have issues with joker especially if if like bat he doesn't kill villains
18/02/2020, 12:50 - Korede: Those ones that don't know what they are saying.
18/02/2020, 12:50 - Korede: He definitely will.
18/02/2020, 12:51 - Ayodele Adewale: Joker that will mess with Cap's emotions
18/02/2020, 12:53 - Korede: Something Batman is used too. Batman is not emotional.
18/02/2020, 12:54 - Korede: Cap will always want to talk good or reason with people (some). 
Batman will knock you out first.
18/02/2020, 12:58 - Ayodele Adewale: Try to reason with joker to your peril
18/02/2020, 12:58 - Korede: Known fact.
18/02/2020, 19:26 - Kolade FUOYE: This message was deleted
18/02/2020, 19:28 - Ayodele Adewale: You don dey work with UN ni baba
18/02/2020, 19:30 - Kolade FUOYE: Confirmed Autopsy.
Stephen Keshi died of cardiac arrest. Please read this tips from a  Cardiologist. It takes you just 2mins.

1. Let’s say it’s 7.25pm and you’re going home (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job.

2. You’re really tired, upset and frustrated. 

3. Suddenly you start experiencing SEVERE PAIN IN YOUR CHEST that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. Yet you are about 3 km from the hospital nearest to your location.

4. Unfortunately you don’t know if you’ll be able to make it that far.

5. You have been trained in CPR, but the guy who taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself.

6 HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE?
Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has only
about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. 

7. However, these victims can help themselves by: 
      i. coughing repeatedly and very vigorously. 
     ii. a deep breath should be taken before each cough
    iii. the cough must be deep and prolonged (as in when trying to produce sputum from deep inside the chest). 
iv. Continue the breathe deep and hard cough repeatedly about every two seconds without letting-up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again.

POINTS TO NOTE:
Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs, while coughing
movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. 
The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. 

Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives!! May be a life of a beloved.

The cardiologist says If everyone who gets this mail can kindly sends it to 30 people, or/and circulate it on your social media profiles, you can bet that many lives of our beloved would be saved.

If this message comes around you ……more than once, please don’t get irritated, it means you have friends who care about you, reminding you of how to tackle a heart attack.
Your wellness increases my happines.

https://energyinst.org/exploring-energy/resources/podcast?utm_source=MailChimp&utm_medium=DIRECTemail&utm_campaign=Episode5
18/02/2020, 19:37 - Kolade FUOYE: Those with the least income are spending the most on energy, and will be the worst affected by climate change. In the final episode of its first season, Energy in Conversation is taking on two of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) which are inextricably linked: SDG 7, affordable and clean energy, and SDG 13, climate action. Our guests, Malcolm Brinded and Anshul Patel, discuss how to help those 840 million people with no electricity and 3 billion cooking with dirty inefficient fuels, without driving up climate warming emissions.

22/02/2020, 22:52 - Enny J: It is a 50-50 chance
22/02/2020, 22:52 - Ayodele Adewale: You do know the meaning of might ba
22/02/2020, 22:52 - Enny J: Yeah I do
22/02/2020, 22:53 - Ayodele Adewale: It's Ola that said I can't say so
22/02/2020, 22:55 - Ayodele Adewale: El Classico next
22/02/2020, 22:56 - Enny J: That will likely be the deciding factor for the league
22/02/2020, 22:59 - Ayodele Adewale: Possibly
22/02/2020, 22:59 - Korede: This one that Messi has awakened. Na die.
22/02/2020, 23:00 - Ayodele Adewale: Lol
22/02/2020, 23:02 - Korede: And this one that Hazard is a ghost now... Pfft. Messi will chop dem.
22/02/2020, 23:03 - Enny J: He should have just stayed at Chelsea
22/02/2020, 23:04 - Enny J: As for courtois
I don't even know what to say about that one
He just became worse
Madrid signings this summer did not hit the nail on the head
22/02/2020, 23:04 - Ayodele Adewale: It's injury
22/02/2020, 23:04 - Ayodele Adewale: This is just his second game back from months of injury
22/02/2020, 23:05 - Ayodele Adewale: Not true
I don't think any keeper in La Liga has more saves
22/02/2020, 23:05 - Korede: God will help him.
22/02/2020, 23:06 - Kolade FUOYE: Courtois actually has been ok to me, na just cos dey lost today.. him dey try.
22/02/2020, 23:06 - Ayodele Adewale: He has been pretty good
22/02/2020, 23:07 - Ayodele Adewale: Might not see the best of him till next season
22/02/2020, 23:08 - Enny J: I don't even know, I don't know their stats
22/02/2020, 23:10 - Ayodele Adewale: Explains why you think he has been bad
22/02/2020, 23:11 - Orisa: The games HV seen tho

He has bn owk

Not too much of the guy in Chelsea bk dn
22/02/2020, 23:12 - Enny J: There are some goals they score him, I will be like how did that get in
Today for instance, he withdrew his hands for ball he probably would have pushed over

His calculations are not top notch, he miscalculates ball most times
22/02/2020, 23:12 - Enny J: I am not good with facts, so I might not be able to point things out
22/02/2020, 23:13 - Orisa: Na so e dey do for Chelsea b4 e left na
22/02/2020, 23:16 - Ayodele Adewale: He wouldn't had made a save even if he didn't pull back
22/02/2020, 23:16 - Ayodele Adewale: He has sha not being a bad keeper
22/02/2020, 23:17 - Orisa: Yea

22/02/2020, 23:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Hazard is injured again
22/02/2020, 23:17 - Orisa: Ah

Is dz normal
22/02/2020, 23:19 - Enny J: Baba is still adapting
Let's hope next season is better for him, if not Madrid don waste money
22/02/2020, 23:19 - Orisa: He would actually come up

The guy just dey well yet ni
22/02/2020, 23:20 - Enny J: I hope so
22/02/2020, 23:23 - Ayodele Adewale: Village people

23/02/2020, 13:35 - Ayodele Adewale: It's not the knock out that's the issue
23/02/2020, 13:35 - Ayodele Adewale: It's that he beat him how a mother will beat a small child that erred
23/02/2020, 13:39 - Prince: Lol

23/02/2020, 13:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Which stupid rematch
23/02/2020, 13:44 - Ayodele Adewale: The first match was a draw and fury wasn't fit
23/02/2020, 13:44 - Oluwatobi K: Except that is in their Clause..
23/02/2020, 13:44 - Ayodele Adewale: This time he was fit
23/02/2020, 13:44 - Oluwatobi K: And this is the second match too
23/02/2020, 13:44 - Ayodele Adewale: And he turned wilder to talking drum
23/02/2020, 13:44 - Ayodele Adewale: If they fight again he fit kill wilder
23/02/2020, 13:45 - Oluwatobi K: We might see Anthony Fury Next tho.

Just scared for Anthony 😕
23/02/2020, 13:45 - Oluwatobi K: Lol
23/02/2020, 13:45 - Enny J: It was not in the clause
Baba won't want to go do like that na, that shit was painful 😩😩
That was why I said he might ask
23/02/2020, 13:45 - Ayodele Adewale: Joshua is smarter and better than Wilder
23/02/2020, 13:45 - Oluwatobi K: Yea
23/02/2020, 13:46 - Ayodele Adewale: The fight will be tough can't say who will win
23/02/2020, 13:46 - Oluwatobi K: True tho.... Just that Fury is Madly Dangerous and currently in Damn Form....
23/02/2020, 13:46 - Oluwatobi K: Yea.. sure
23/02/2020, 13:46 - Ayodele Adewale: Lemme mention a snippet of an interview Joshua did and agreed that fury will be the tougher opponent for him
23/02/2020, 13:47 - Oluwatobi K: It's very clear..
23/02/2020, 13:47 - Oluwatobi K: Although,. AJ still have a match to defend one of his title this year.

If they speak to you in Hausa and you say you don't understand. That's the end of the discussion.

26/02/2020, 23:00 - SUG: He has a pattern but not with all those midfielders now
26/02/2020, 23:00 - Enny J: If na good coach, he is meant to have find a way by now to play out his tactics
26/02/2020, 23:00 - SUG: Dybala is even trying now
26/02/2020, 23:01 - Enny J: If the guy go barca weh be say their pattern na passing.. The guy go still fuck up
26/02/2020, 23:01 - SUG: This are problems coaches like him will always face
26/02/2020, 23:02 - Enny J: I watch one of their match for seria A
Commentators open mouth talk say since sarri come juventus that everything has changed and all the matches can't be written of for juventus unlike before
26/02/2020, 23:02 - Enny J: Even for their own league, them they struggle win match.. Something they are not known for before
26/02/2020, 23:03 - SUG: Their league no easy again
26/02/2020, 23:03 - SUG: Things don change now
26/02/2020, 23:03 - SUG: See laliga

26/02/2020, 23:04 - SUG: I believe those players can't play is pattern
26/02/2020, 23:04 - Enny J: About LA Liga
Shit happens, though I don't expect Madrid and barca to dominate for ever

In a couple of years, I give both team maximum of 5 years, they will start struggling also
26/02/2020, 23:05 - Enny J: No problem sha
Na my ororo I just they pity
If not, wetin concern me with juventus
26/02/2020, 23:05 - SUG: Ororo is even trying with that age
26/02/2020, 23:05 - SUG: And those set of players

26/02/2020, 23:07 - SUG: Thou I know man city will want to put pressure for this camp league due to that ban
26/02/2020, 23:08 - Ayodele Adewale: Enny is right 
Juve haven't exact being exceptional this season
26/02/2020, 23:08 - Ayodele Adewale: Sarri hasn't gotten that team up to speed at all
26/02/2020, 23:08 - SUG: See those players now
26/02/2020, 23:08 - Ayodele Adewale: 1
26/02/2020, 23:08 - Enny J: Same players allegri used
26/02/2020, 23:09 - Enny J: Abi wetin be him name self
26/02/2020, 23:09 - Ayodele Adewale: It's not about players 
It's his style
26/02/2020, 23:09 - SUG: Pattern different
26/02/2020, 23:09 - SUG: That is what I am saying
26/02/2020, 23:09 - Ayodele Adewale: Some players have complained a little self
26/02/2020, 23:09 - SUG: To me 
Ronaldo can't play that former style
26/02/2020, 23:09 - Ayodele Adewale: If you watched their match today
26/02/2020, 23:09 - SUG: That allegri style
26/02/2020, 23:10 - Ayodele Adewale: Maybe only Ronaldo played well
26/02/2020, 23:10 - Ayodele Adewale: You obviously don't watch seria a
26/02/2020, 23:10 - SUG: Those guys can't play with him well
26/02/2020, 23:10 - SUG: I do
26/02/2020, 23:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Play with who well
26/02/2020, 23:11 - Ayodele Adewale: What are you saying bayi
26/02/2020, 23:11 - SUG: The only person that understand him is dybala and this guy for midfielder
26/02/2020, 23:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Under Allegri 
Juve were more or less unbeatable
26/02/2020, 23:11 - SUG: Sure
26/02/2020, 23:12 - SUG: The reason is

Years he managed the team
26/02/2020, 23:12 - Ayodele Adewale: It's this season that Sarri hasn't been able to get the best out of them
He even froze Dyabala out at the beginning of the team
26/02/2020, 23:12 - SUG: Yap
26/02/2020, 23:13 - Ayodele Adewale: So what are you saying that Ronaldo couldn't play well or play Allegri's pattern
26/02/2020, 23:13 - Ayodele Adewale: From his first season they were untouchable in the league even before Ronaldo
26/02/2020, 23:14 - SUG: Before allegri came 

Who won Italian league
26/02/2020, 23:14 - SUG: ??
26/02/2020, 23:15 - Ayodele Adewale: You obviously saw when o said from his first season ba
26/02/2020, 23:15 - SUG: Yes
26/02/2020, 23:16 - SUG: I am just asking that one as a question
26/02/2020, 23:16 - SUG: Hin don tey we juve hot for that league 

Since AC Milan and inter the mumu
26/02/2020, 23:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Conte
26/02/2020, 23:17 - SUG: Allegri came and add more pressure
26/02/2020, 23:17 - SUG: Conte did well with them
26/02/2020, 23:17 - SUG: Very well self
26/02/2020, 23:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Conte won about 3 or 4 league titles with Juve before Allegri
26/02/2020, 23:18 - SUG: Exactly
26/02/2020, 23:19 - SUG: This is my point

Sarri does not have players to do his own job well, and it is affecting ororo
26/02/2020, 23:19 - SUG: Ororo will play times 2 if players come
26/02/2020, 23:20 - SUG: He is even trying for league self
26/02/2020, 23:20 - SUG: Counting goals
26/02/2020, 23:20 - SUG: But camp league will be difficult
26/02/2020, 23:23 - Ayodele Adewale: The major reason Sarri has issued is more or less the same with Mou they are too stubborn and refuse to adapt thier style to suit the players available to them
26/02/2020, 23:23 - SUG: Ohhh
26/02/2020, 23:25 - Okiki Bello: Imagine after all the results problems i had, someone should now say they can't find them again.. Epe

27/02/2020, 20:45 - Ayodele Adewale: And there's a reason
And it's not because of a lack of appreciation
27/02/2020, 20:55 - Oluwatobi K: What reason?

28/02/2020, 15:44 - Okiki Bello: Hopefully, it starts and end with him!

But what about the other people that came from Italy?
28/02/2020, 15:44 - SUG: Most countries were very ready

Only God can save this

If someone has poured spit somewhere before and it has dried, once you come in contact with it, you are infected
You are infected through body contact, that is swear

28/02/2020, 16:26 - Korede: If it comes down to it and disease or virus is likely to become epidemic or pandemic and it has no cure, killing a few thousand is preferable to allowing millions or billions to get infected. 
It is a last resort.

01/03/2020, 22:41 - Olisa: To me, it's like their midfielders don't like attempting to score.. they're always trying to find the strikers.. the don't seem to be confident.. when you expect them to attack, they'll be playing backwards..
01/03/2020, 22:41 - Ayodele Adewale: Finding spaces
01/03/2020, 22:41 - Ayodele Adewale: Even Messi is not in the game

09/03/2020, 13:52 - Ayodele Adewale: If they don't protest it's Sanusi was/is progressive
09/03/2020, 13:52 - Okiki Bello: Sanusi was trying to increase the number of literacy and reduce the number of illiteracy. Also reduce the number of Almajiri. But thus people like poverty!
09/03/2020, 13:53 - Ayodele Adewale: Interesting 
Never knew

09/03/2020, 13:54 - Okiki Bello: They like giving birth to many children and sending them to the streets. So they can beg for food and later be radicalized for terrorism

09/03/2020, 13:56 - Ayodele Adewale: Okay

09/03/2020, 13:59 - Enny J: Why will I lie about that
09/03/2020, 13:59 - Ayodele Adewale: The major problem of the north is illiteracy and their leaders know how to use it to thier advantage 
So they don't exactly want it to reduce
09/03/2020, 14:00 - Ayodele Adewale: It's not as if they just want to give birth and start training their children to be violent
09/03/2020, 14:01 - Ayodele Adewale: Sometimes when you people talk about violence and ish, it's almost as if it only happens in the north
09/03/2020, 14:04 - Okiki Bello: Wow! They are nice, good people. Very religious. I respect them. But......

12/03/2020, 14:15 - Ayodele Adewale: Still wonder what Saudi Arabia hopes to gain by flooding the market
12/03/2020, 14:15 - Ayodele Adewale: They are hurting the whole world including themselves
12/03/2020, 14:15 - Prince: How please 
I have not been online
12/03/2020, 14:16 - Enny J: Yeah, we are getting there soon
Couple of days it will get to 500+
12/03/2020, 14:16 - Ayodele Adewale: So basically there's OPEC and there's Russia
12/03/2020, 14:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Their collation is known as OPEC+ I think
12/03/2020, 14:17 - Enny J: Was it not Saudi Aramco that was bombed last year? Have they fixed the facility again?
12/03/2020, 14:17 - Prince: Its not good
12/03/2020, 14:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Russia is not a member of the normal OPEC
12/03/2020, 14:17 - Ayodele Adewale: Just a part of the facility and they have been operational since then
12/03/2020, 14:18 - Enny J: Yeah, but if nothing is done fast
That is what will likely happen
12/03/2020, 14:18 - Enny J: Nawa o
It is well

I don't even know the story behind all these self
12/03/2020, 14:18 - Ayodele Adewale: So anyways this coalition dictates how much oil is sold and in what quantity it is sold
12/03/2020, 14:18 - Ayodele Adewale: You get the drift ba Prince
12/03/2020, 14:19 - Enny J: Yeah
12/03/2020, 14:19 - Enny J: So if I get you right, Saudi is not following the rules?
12/03/2020, 14:19 - Ayodele Adewale: So OPEC through Saudi has been negotiating with Russia 
Trying to settle on a price and other things
12/03/2020, 14:19 - Ayodele Adewale: I haven't finished
12/03/2020, 14:20 - Enny J: Okay, let me wait
12/03/2020, 14:20 - Ayodele Adewale: But they've not being able to reach an agreement
12/03/2020, 14:20 - Ayodele Adewale: The talks broke down
12/03/2020, 14:21 - Ayodele Adewale: Saudi vexed and decided since Russia doesn't want to play ball
They might as well fuck the market up for everybody
12/03/2020, 14:21 - Ayodele Adewale: So they flood the market with crude oil which invariably crashes the price of oil
12/03/2020, 14:22 - Enny J: Ohhh
12/03/2020, 14:22 - Ayodele Adewale: Which in turn has affected all types of oil and is affecting the world's economy as a whole
12/03/2020, 14:24 - Ayodele Adewale: Thing is countries with other exports can still manage to survive for a bit but it will still hit them hard if the situation is not resolved soon
12/03/2020, 14:26 - Ayodele Adewale: Then we have our country our major if not sole export is oil
Our budget was drawn up with the oil peged at fifty something dollars or so
But now oil is selling at about 20-30 dollars less than that assumption
12/03/2020, 14:27 - Ayodele Adewale: Which is not good for our economy
12/03/2020, 14:27 - Ayodele Adewale: So we like other oil dependent countries need the crisis to end fast
12/03/2020, 14:28 - Enny J: It is well, let's see how it all plays out
12/03/2020, 14:28 - Ayodele Adewale: Yeah yeah
12/03/2020, 14:29 - Ayodele Adewale: If the world leaders don't stop acting like babies this stuff can plunge the world into a recession 2.0
12/03/2020, 14:29 - Prince: Hm
12/03/2020, 14:30 - Ayodele Adewale: If not worse than the great depression
12/03/2020, 14:30 - Okiki Bello: Seems it's coming to the end of the world!
12/03/2020, 14:41 - Enny J: Guy!!! I never enjoy life abeg

But I'm not ready to start world war Z. What do you think will happen if news gets out that nations want to start killing all Corona infected and quarantined people, you think they won't decide to fuck us all up by knowingly spreading the virus?! 😒
12/03/2020, 16:28 - Korede: Even the penguins in Antarctica will catch it. 
Please killing them never reach to be option ooo.

12/03/2020, 16:31 - Korede: The World Economy is crashing at a steady state.
12/03/2020, 16:31 - Korede: Rice is now high again. 
There might be fuel strike.
12/03/2020, 16:31 - Enny J: Yeah, so the cycle continues
You recover from it
Someone that's has it meets you, you get it again
12/03/2020, 16:31 - Enny J: If I am world leader
I will kill everyone with the virus
12/03/2020, 16:31 - Orisa: And d problem is the wickedness of people 

Imagine spitting on elevator button

12/03/2020, 16:32 - Orisa: Even with that its not sure its gonna clear coz u don't know where it has reached

U would have to do worldwide disinfection after killing them

So even killing won't solve it
12/03/2020, 16:33 - Orisa: Dz z wah is still spreading that virus

If only human being are not desperately wicked
12/03/2020, 16:33 - Orisa: Y no die ur die must somebody die ur die with u ni

Do you have sense sir
12/03/2020, 17:43 - Orisa: No stress

Where are u coming from sir

12/03/2020, 17:48 - Prince: I cant see this
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Ayodele Adewale: You are talking about hydrocarbons like they are not gotten from oil
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Korede: How many of those machines have even been kinked or adjust to using other fuel sources.
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Korede: *adjusted
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Prince: Let him tell me about fuel first b4 we start breaking down
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Ayodele Adewale: Or is better to say make up oil self
12/03/2020, 17:51 - Ayodele Adewale: @2349066181649 how much solar energy or electricity do you think will power one tractor
12/03/2020, 17:51 - Ayodele Adewale: Plus all the regular tractors we see now will be useless
12/03/2020, 17:52 - Ayodele Adewale: As new one tractors with more electrical parts than mechanical will have to be developed
12/03/2020, 17:53 - Korede: Orisa is thinking new age farming. And it is a wonderful idea.
12/03/2020, 17:53 - Orisa: Wind mills are efficient tho with a tractor drawbar and more economical 

But I was just joking around sha

We surely need fuel 

My point was investing in agriculture was not a bad idea

It was sir prince that brought up fuel and I said we could actually do without fuel

Lobatan
12/03/2020, 17:53 - Kolade FUOYE: 🤔
12/03/2020, 17:53 - Orisa: If right capital is involved
12/03/2020, 17:54 - Korede: At this present stage, we can't do without fuel.

12/03/2020, 17:55 - Ayodele Adewale: Erm 
That's why I asked for you to explain
12/03/2020, 17:55 - Orisa: Tractor works on rotation to mechanical 

On a norms 

The fuel helps to power the rotation part
12/03/2020, 17:55 - Korede: The wind the turbine generates will be blowing the tractor therefore making it move. 🤣🤣🤣
12/03/2020, 17:55 - Ayodele Adewale: I know the wind is a good  source
12/03/2020, 17:56 - Ayodele Adewale: Don't let me remove you oh

12/03/2020, 17:57 - Orisa: The tractor has something called PTO shaft connected to the draw bar and to the wheels sha

So if u can get the right wind power needed to can rotate the PTO shaft and hence move the tractor since the PTO are connected to wheels
12/03/2020, 17:57 - Korede: No mind me. 🤣
12/03/2020, 17:59 - Orisa: Actually

Same thing also we can use wind to charge up stuff I get
12/03/2020, 18:03 - Ayodele Adewale: The downside is it can't be windy everyday

12/03/2020, 22:02 - Ayodele Adewale: North or South

12/03/2020, 22:06 - Enny J: Yeah
12/03/2020, 22:07 - Ayodele Adewale: The reason is because Italy has more old people
12/03/2020, 22:07 - Enny J: Ohh, okay
12/03/2020, 22:08 - Ayodele Adewale: Old people are susceptible to the disease and it kills them more
12/03/2020, 22:09 - Ayodele Adewale: Young healthy people that don't have any preconditions that get infected normally recover

13/03/2020, 12:36 - Oluwatobi K: The next thing is to cancel the league null and void... Everything should start over 🌝
13/03/2020, 12:36 - Korede: You do realize that can't happen.

13/03/2020, 17:10 - Okiki Bello: I think they used those two cases to collect money from the treasury!

13/03/2020, 17:13 - Kolade FUOYE: Yehhhh😂😂😂
14/03/2020, 07:38 - Korede: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 11:30 - Enny J: It can only be that there was no Corona virus in the first place, it was all lies to get money from the government
14/03/2020, 11:31 - Ayodele Adewale: What exactly is wrong with you
14/03/2020, 11:31 - Ayodele Adewale: Is it bad for there to be good news in Nigeria
14/03/2020, 11:33 - Enny J: It is not bad
14/03/2020, 11:33 - Enny J: But all those things were just lies
14/03/2020, 11:33 - Enny J: It is too good to be true
14/03/2020, 11:33 - Ayodele Adewale: How is it bad that people recovered
14/03/2020, 11:34 - Ayodele Adewale: All the people that recovered around the world is true
14/03/2020, 11:34 - Ayodele Adewale: Only those that recovered in Nigeria is false
14/03/2020, 11:34 - Ayodele Adewale: I ask again what exactly is wrong with you??
14/03/2020, 11:34 - Enny J: They can't tell me those two people did not come in contact with two before they were taken to hospital.. They just came up with figures saying the checked some people and they got the virus
14/03/2020, 11:35 - Ayodele Adewale: You obviously didn't follow the story
14/03/2020, 11:35 - Enny J: I followed it, a post was also posted on the group also about the story
14/03/2020, 11:35 - Ayodele Adewale: So I'll just assume it's lack of information that's wrong with you
14/03/2020, 11:36 - Ayodele Adewale: If you really followed it you will see people were quarantined in Ogun
14/03/2020, 11:36 - Ayodele Adewale: And they just got released yester day
14/03/2020, 11:37 - Ayodele Adewale: You will know that the second case got infected by the first and has being confirmed recovered
14/03/2020, 11:37 - Enny J: All those stories does not add up to me. Everyone are free with their own opinion though


Last last we go deh alright sha
14/03/2020, 11:37 - Ayodele Adewale: You are looking for conspiracy where there's none
14/03/2020, 11:38 - Ayodele Adewale: So you would have happy if more than two people got infected
14/03/2020, 11:38 - Ayodele Adewale: You would have been happy if people died
14/03/2020, 11:38 - Ayodele Adewale: You would have been happy if Nigeria turned out to be like Italy
14/03/2020, 11:39 - Ayodele Adewale: You would have been happy if we are experiencing a lock down now
14/03/2020, 11:39 - Ayodele Adewale: So that the story will add up to you ba  @2349077283888
14/03/2020, 11:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Do you know how stupid your argument sounds
14/03/2020, 11:40 - Ayodele Adewale: If you really have info about the virus you will know the weather in Africa doesn't let it thrive
14/03/2020, 11:41 - Ayodele Adewale: But no you are happy to believe that the govt lied so they can steal money
14/03/2020, 11:41 - Ayodele Adewale: Newsflash they don't need to falsify pandemic patients to steal money
14/03/2020, 11:42 - Enny J: Hmmm
I have heard you, and you have a point 

But I still stand with my opinion though
14/03/2020, 11:42 - Ayodele Adewale: So just you know patient zero is still in isolation till he tests negative again
14/03/2020, 11:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Then you are just being knowing stupid which is scary
14/03/2020, 11:44 - Korede: 😂 😂 😂
14/03/2020, 11:44 - SUG: 😂 😂 😂
14/03/2020, 11:45 - Ayodele Adewale: Is true now 
How will you just convince yourself that the government made up the fact that people are sick
14/03/2020, 11:45 - Korede: BB is angry.
14/03/2020, 11:45 - Ayodele Adewale: To what end na
14/03/2020, 11:46 - Korede: The unbelief in this nation ehn. 🤣🤣🤣
14/03/2020, 11:46 - Ayodele Adewale: If they want money, All they need to do is inflate the cost of a project and get a company to win said project
14/03/2020, 11:46 - Korede: See wetin our government cause. 💁🏾‍♂
People can't believe good news in peace again.
14/03/2020, 11:47 - Ayodele Adewale: This particular unbelief is just plain silliness
14/03/2020, 11:47 - Ayodele Adewale: Stupidity
14/03/2020, 11:47 - Ayodele Adewale: Let's be frank
14/03/2020, 11:47 - Korede: The way BB attacked this issue ehn... I don't know why I am laughing!!!
14/03/2020, 11:47 - Korede: Ahn Ahn. Take it easy. He just said his candid opinion.
14/03/2020, 11:48 - Ayodele Adewale: There are more recoveries than death around the world
14/03/2020, 11:49 - Ayodele Adewale: But since it's not the worst possible outcome in Nigeria 
Then it must be a lie
14/03/2020, 11:49 - Korede: Many Nigerians don't believe in the system and believe that our government will do anything to, even lie about a pandemic to steal. It's not entirely their fault, it's just how our government has made them to believe by their actions. 


But still, I don't believe this issue of the Corona in Nigeria was false.
14/03/2020, 11:49 - Korede: 🤷🏾‍♂
14/03/2020, 11:50 - Korede: Anyways BB don't be annoyed. 😘
14/03/2020, 11:50 - Ayodele Adewale: That means WHO who commended Nigeria's handling of it don't know what they are saying
14/03/2020, 11:52 - Ayodele Adewale: The reason why you should get all the necessary information about an issue before talking
14/03/2020, 11:52 - Korede: Nigerians believe bad news easily before anything else.
14/03/2020, 11:52 - Ayodele Adewale: NDDC because of Ebola got the country ready for any such outbreak
14/03/2020, 11:53 - Ayodele Adewale: So the mechanics of containing this things best to Our ability have been put in place before now
14/03/2020, 11:54 - Ayodele Adewale: NDDC is one of the few organisations in the country headed by professionals in their field
14/03/2020, 11:55 - Ayodele Adewale: But instead of commending thier efforts and the fact that they put themselves at risk for the general safety of the general public
14/03/2020, 11:56 - Korede: I just Eniola won't try this thing he did here today again. At least not when BB is online. 😆
14/03/2020, 11:56 - Korede: *know
14/03/2020, 12:00 - Ayodele Adewale: Please let's believe that the ministry of health got an Italian to pretend to be sick 
Got the Ogun state ministry of health to pretend to transport him to the NDDC centre in Lagos and quarantine people 
Get the Lagos state ministry of health to corroborate the story 
Then find another person to claim to be sick 
Then after a while come out and say the patients have recovered with statements from the commissioners of health from the two states, the head of NDDC, the minister of health. Then set up a visit to channels 10' o clock for the minister of state for health
14/03/2020, 12:00 - Ayodele Adewale: Just to get money from the Federal government
14/03/2020, 12:01 - Korede: Now that you put it that way...
14/03/2020, 12:02 - Ayodele Adewale: When they could just claim they want to buy ambulances for community health centres put the cost of each ambulance at 100million and go ahead to buy 20 instead of the maybe 200 they quoted for
14/03/2020, 12:02 - Ayodele Adewale: That is what he is claiming na
14/03/2020, 12:03 - Ayodele Adewale: I even forgot to add they managed to get the WHO in on this scheme
14/03/2020, 12:04 - Korede: 🤣 BB you wildin'. It is okay na.
14/03/2020, 12:04 - Ayodele Adewale: But what do I know 
Who am I to stop Enny from believing what will be arguably the grandest corruption schemes in the country
14/03/2020, 12:05 - Ayodele Adewale: I have heard
14/03/2020, 12:06 - Enny J: Even if this is a corruption scheme, it can't even be among the top 10 plotted by this so called country
14/03/2020, 12:07 - Enny J: You act like we are not in these country together, not everything can be taken seriously. The country need to do more to prove to their people not just by all the things you listed..
14/03/2020, 12:08 - Enny J: By the way, I guess you are done typing?
That's cool, point noted

Oya take a chill pill and rest
14/03/2020, 12:08 - Babayomi: Eniola get Issues ooo
14/03/2020, 12:08 - Ayodele Adewale: Enny no vex
14/03/2020, 12:08 - Ayodele Adewale: Next time to convince you ba
14/03/2020, 12:08 - Babayomi: It's not easy to convince Enny sha
14/03/2020, 12:08 - Ayodele Adewale: Buhari will have visit the containment centre
14/03/2020, 12:09 - Enny J: This is not about issues
Are you guys not in these country, don't you know what is happening?


Is it just by things written in the paper that will prove things were done right
14/03/2020, 12:10 - Ayodele Adewale: And for your information Enny for a corruption scheme to work it does not go into the news
14/03/2020, 12:10 - Ayodele Adewale: More often than not not up to 10 people know about it
14/03/2020, 12:10 - Ayodele Adewale: See Enny you've chosen what to believe
It's not up to me to convince you
14/03/2020, 12:10 - Enny J: As I said earlier they can quarantine everybody that came in contact with the Italian.. About the weather part, is Nigeria weather compared to those with large number of cases around the world
14/03/2020, 12:11 - Ayodele Adewale: And I told you they actually quarantined them
14/03/2020, 12:11 - Ayodele Adewale: Nigeria is hot
14/03/2020, 12:12 - Ayodele Adewale: Those other places are not
14/03/2020, 12:12 - Ayodele Adewale: How many Africans have actually contacted the virus
14/03/2020, 12:12 - Korede: This is where I give you the

😒

14/03/2020, 12:13 - Enny J: The Lagos ibadan road
We all know how many times it went into the news
The onitsha - Enugu express we all know how many times it went into the news

The second river Niger bridge, we all know how many times it went into the news...


The thing is that we don't have bodies to keep sanity in these country, when the professional bodies that are to regulate things are all under the federal government pay rolls
14/03/2020, 12:13 - Enny J: Whatever
14/03/2020, 12:14 - Enny J: It is well sha
We go deh alright last last

I am out
14/03/2020, 12:15 - Ayodele Adewale: Don't know about the enugu road 
But so you know the first contractor for Lag-IB was convicted for corruption if I remember well
That why the contract was given to Berger and I can't remember the other company
14/03/2020, 12:15 - Ayodele Adewale: The second Niger bridge contract just got awarded in this government
14/03/2020, 12:16 - Ayodele Adewale: And when I say in the news I mean the shady deals of true corruption in this country don't make it to the news
14/03/2020, 12:17 - Enny J: Okay, no problem
14/03/2020, 12:17 - Enny J: It is well sha
14/03/2020, 12:19 - Prince: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 12:19 - Prince: Who do giveaway
14/03/2020, 12:19 - Korede: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 12:20 - Ayodele Adewale: Your brother believes the corona virus never entered Nigeria because the two confirmed cases were announced to have recovered yesterday
14/03/2020, 12:27 - Prince: Which of my brothers
14/03/2020, 12:33 - SUG: 🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂
14/03/2020, 12:40 - Prince: Eniola always have yeye opinion to this 

I dont know when he became like this
14/03/2020, 13:29 - Kolade FUOYE: Our opinions can't be same na
14/03/2020, 13:40 - Prince: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 13:48 - Babayomi: Lol
14/03/2020, 16:15 - Okiki Bello: I saw this. I was happy
14/03/2020, 16:16 - Okiki Bello: This message was deleted
14/03/2020, 16:19 - Okiki Bello: I totally understand where Eni is coming from. Before you believe a thing in this country. You have to see it.
14/03/2020, 16:21 - Okiki Bello: Lai Mohammed still lied on an international interview that the Nigeria senate are not proposing the Social Media Amendment bill. Lol. They had a committee sit on the proposal this week
14/03/2020, 16:29 - Ayodele Adewale: That's a bill na
14/03/2020, 16:29 - Ayodele Adewale: You can't compare that to  health
14/03/2020, 16:32 - Okiki Bello: Isn't that deceit?

To be honest, i have lost faith in whatever the Government says.
14/03/2020, 16:33 - Ayodele Adewale: You do realise that in the case of the bill it's just one person that lied
14/03/2020, 16:34 - Ayodele Adewale: In this case more than one person spoke about the corona virus
14/03/2020, 16:35 - Ayodele Adewale: So you believe professionals in this case doctors who spent years getting their degrees
14/03/2020, 16:36 - Ayodele Adewale: Without any real gain put thier integrity and professional certificate on the line
14/03/2020, 16:36 - Okiki Bello: I had my doubts about the virus in Nigeria as at yesterday. Until i read more. I still have little doubts, tho.
14/03/2020, 16:36 - Okiki Bello: There was an Italian in Nigeria, he had the virus.
14/03/2020, 16:37 - Ayodele Adewale: To claim Nigeria had corona virus when it's not as if there's an exclusive club in the world where they give countries money for having corona virus
14/03/2020, 16:37 - Ayodele Adewale: Yes 
Patient zero
He is still in quarantine till they get a second negative test
14/03/2020, 16:38 - Okiki Bello: BB. My point is, you need to understand where Eniola is coming from. This government has been a joke.
14/03/2020, 16:39 - Ayodele Adewale: I am not defending the government
14/03/2020, 16:39 - Ayodele Adewale: What I am saying is why lie??
14/03/2020, 16:39 - Okiki Bello: At some point, i felt maybe the minister of health just wanted to collect the lots of money he requested for to prevent Corona virus.
14/03/2020, 16:39 - Ayodele Adewale: To what end?
14/03/2020, 16:40 - SUG: About the virus or what 
Or about their past situations
14/03/2020, 16:40 - Okiki Bello: Past situations, of course!
14/03/2020, 16:40 - Ayodele Adewale: They don't need to invent a patient to do that 
Hope you know
14/03/2020, 16:43 - SUG: We so much have one mind set in this country ehn
14/03/2020, 16:44 - Korede: They don't need to formulate that we have a virus to collect money. These people steal without permission. 💁🏾‍♂
14/03/2020, 16:44 - Ayodele Adewale: There's something you people are not looking at
Let's think along your line that they wanted to steal money
Do you know the number of people that have gotten involved 
How do you guaranty they will all keep shut 
1. Minister of health
2. Minister of State for health 
3. The Italian 
4. The Director of NDDC
5. Commissioner of health in Ogun
6. Commissioner of health in Lagos 
7. The ambulance driver
8. The people that got quarantine
14/03/2020, 16:44 - Ayodele Adewale: And there's more
14/03/2020, 16:44 - Okiki Bello: Lol.. "At some point"
14/03/2020, 16:45 - Ayodele Adewale: Exactly
14/03/2020, 16:45 - Okiki Bello: Which mind set?
14/03/2020, 16:45 - Korede: Besides I'm almost sure some funds were still taken from the allotted fees given to them. If they needed 700m they'd ask for 1b.
14/03/2020, 16:45 - SUG: 😆
14/03/2020, 16:45 - Ayodele Adewale: Nothing good can happen in the country
14/03/2020, 16:45 - Ayodele Adewale: That mindset
14/03/2020, 16:45 - SUG: I tell u
14/03/2020, 16:45 - Korede: Including WHO.
14/03/2020, 16:46 - SUG: So black minded
14/03/2020, 16:46 - Korede: The happening mindset.
14/03/2020, 16:46 - Okiki Bello: That's not my mindset. I do believe i would prosper in this country!

Don't know about others
14/03/2020, 16:47 - Okiki Bello: Okay oh!
14/03/2020, 16:47 - Ayodele Adewale: Besides hope you guys know that no African country has recorded any death from this virus
14/03/2020, 16:47 - SUG: Just wake up on morning and believe nothing good can never happen 

And if they see it happening 
They find another way to wash it down
14/03/2020, 16:47 - SUG: As in ehn for crying out loud
14/03/2020, 16:48 - Okiki Bello: You are saying nonsense already!
14/03/2020, 16:48 - Ayodele Adewale: He is not
14/03/2020, 16:49 - Okiki Bello: No faith in the current government doesn't mean i don't believe something good would happen.
14/03/2020, 16:49 - Ayodele Adewale: This is exactly what Eni was alluding to this money
14/03/2020, 16:49 - Ayodele Adewale: Exact same thing you are supporting him for this evening
14/03/2020, 16:49 - SUG: How many of your hopes do you want to place on anyone who goes into powet
14/03/2020, 16:50 - Okiki Bello: What are the good things happening in the country Ogbeni Ola?
14/03/2020, 16:50 - Okiki Bello: I can't even attend my favorite uncle's wedding because i am scared of kidnappers. Shooo!!!
14/03/2020, 16:51 - Okiki Bello: Abeg.. Don't cut another vein, pls!
14/03/2020, 16:52 - SUG: A man could not attend his mother burier 14 years ago because of kidnappers 

Should applaud or bring down everyone
14/03/2020, 16:52 - Ayodele Adewale: Second Niger Bridge has being started 
The railways are being revived 
Etc
14/03/2020, 16:52 - SUG: So people were afraid 20 years ago
14/03/2020, 16:52 - Okiki Bello: They have done well in preventing Corona Virus.

What are the other good things?
14/03/2020, 16:52 - SUG: They close eyes to good things

14/03/2020, 16:54 - Ayodele Adewale: For years the railways system was dead
14/03/2020, 16:54 - SUG: Were u told it will be a fast train
14/03/2020, 16:55 - Okiki Bello: World is not using this slow equipment again.
14/03/2020, 16:55 - Okiki Bello: They are even proposing a bill to stop the use of generators... Lmao! No light o
14/03/2020, 16:55 - SUG: At least there was non there, bad and dead

14/03/2020, 16:55 - Korede: He is stating the fact!
14/03/2020, 16:56 - SUG: So black minded ehn
14/03/2020, 16:56 - Ayodele Adewale: You know that is the work of a senator
14/03/2020, 16:56 - Ayodele Adewale: Not the federal government
14/03/2020, 16:56 - SUG: He should know
14/03/2020, 16:56 - Okiki Bello: Lol.. Wait till it passes the second hearing!

14/03/2020, 16:57 - Okiki Bello: That's was what we said during the social media bill. It has a committee now!
14/03/2020, 16:57 - Korede: See I have entered the train from Abuja to Kaduna and it is fucking fastm
14/03/2020, 16:57 - SUG: Shey they can pass bill again ni

14/03/2020, 17:00 - Okiki Bello: Wasn't it the same Abuja to Kaduna railway, the minister of Transportation was reported to have been attacked and his DSS killed
14/03/2020, 17:00 - Korede: You won't applaud the progress, only undermining it. Shioor
14/03/2020, 17:00 - Ayodele Adewale: Kad-Abj is 1hr by train
14/03/2020, 17:01 - Ayodele Adewale: It wasn't on the railway

Our roads are good.

Police is our friend.

People in the Northwest part of this country are safe.

Our Naira didn't devalue this week.

We won't even be experiencing fuel problems soon according to experts.

14/03/2020, 17:02 - Okiki Bello: Our elections are going on smoothly.
14/03/2020, 17:03 - Okiki Bello: Since last year.. Has it improved?
14/03/2020, 17:03 - Okiki Bello: That has been the case since ten years back. Always giving it to someone
14/03/2020, 17:03 - Ayodele Adewale: That project will likely have being finished before that generator bill is passed
14/03/2020, 17:04 - Ayodele Adewale: That deal was struck this year fa

14/03/2020, 17:09 - Okiki Bello: In fact, it's the right direction that the world is going as the giant of Africa that we are.
14/03/2020, 17:09 - Okiki Bello: You people need to open your eyes fah!
14/03/2020, 17:12 - Korede: We ate not saying all things are all well and good.

Hope you know
14/03/2020, 17:12 - Okiki Bello: In Africa you mean?
14/03/2020, 17:13 - Korede: We are saying the mentality is so bad that even the good things that are happening you won't see or Commend.
14/03/2020, 17:13 - Ayodele Adewale: Africa I mean
14/03/2020, 17:13 - SUG: I just give up
14/03/2020, 17:13 - Okiki Bello: I don't know. But you do realize that Kenyans and Ethiopia are thriving than us! And we have more intellectuals than them.
14/03/2020, 17:14 - Ayodele Adewale: Google the largest economy in Africa
14/03/2020, 17:14 - Korede: We are not where we are supposed to be but still...
14/03/2020, 17:14 - Okiki Bello: Please let me correct this. If a good thing happens, i would commend him. I still thanked him for 33k increase and 30k minimum wage. Please let's be mindful. No one should say i have a black mind again!
14/03/2020, 17:15 - Okiki Bello: It's WhatsApp data bundle i have. Can you help check, pls?

14/03/2020, 17:24 - Ayodele Adewale: Unless you want me to paste a screen shot of proof
14/03/2020, 17:24 - Ayodele Adewale: Why will I lie
14/03/2020, 17:24 - Okiki Bello: Of course yes
14/03/2020, 17:31 - Ayodele Adewale: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 17:31 - Ayodele Adewale: Shey you are happy now
14/03/2020, 17:33 - Okiki Bello: Oh... Thumbs up to the government!
14/03/2020, 17:33 - Ayodele Adewale: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/08/nigeria-africa-economy/
14/03/2020, 17:33 - Okiki Bello: Fantabulous, they are doing well
14/03/2020, 17:36 - Okiki Bello: Wow. The government is doing well. I have turned a blind eye to all this. They are doing well
14/03/2020, 18:46 - Enny J: Hmmm. Una no deh tire?
14/03/2020, 18:47 - Olisa: Sometimes I wonder how these guys come up with these economic statistics. With all the hardships and issues in this Nigeria, we are still the best economy in Africa.. I really don't understand.
14/03/2020, 18:50 - Babayomi: IMO when they say best economy I feel it's about the ease of doing businesses, it may not necessarily affect the lives of the citizens
14/03/2020, 18:50 - Enny J: Based on my time in training school
Gdp per capital is the real deal
14/03/2020, 18:50 - Enny J: Based on this
Nigeria is not top 3
14/03/2020, 18:51 - Babayomi: Our GDP is not the highest in Africa
14/03/2020, 18:51 - Babayomi: Exactly
14/03/2020, 18:51 - Babayomi: Not sure we are even in the top 10
14/03/2020, 18:51 - Enny J: Gdp per capital means your total gpd over the total population
14/03/2020, 18:52 - Babayomi: I know
14/03/2020, 18:52 - Korede: Even at that it is still higher than the Kenya and Ethiopia Okiki was comparing us to.
14/03/2020, 18:52 - Babayomi: So our population won't even make it that high
14/03/2020, 18:52 - Babayomi: That's y u see the likes of Luxembourg being ranked first
14/03/2020, 18:52 - Korede: Exactly. 200m people no be beans.
14/03/2020, 18:52 - Ayodele Adewale: Ease of doing business is a different metric
14/03/2020, 18:53 - Korede: 🙌🏾
14/03/2020, 18:53 - Enny J: South Africa with their low population  almost half of Nigeria is almost able to get what Nigeria got with a full population
14/03/2020, 18:53 - Enny J: I might be wrong though
14/03/2020, 18:53 - Enny J: Yeah, sure
14/03/2020, 18:54 - Ayodele Adewale: South Africa is in a recession as we speak
14/03/2020, 18:54 - Korede: SA population isn't even up to half of ours.
14/03/2020, 18:54 - Korede: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 18:54 - Enny J: Yeah, true
14/03/2020, 18:55 - Enny J: I saw it on Twitter
I can't remember when
14/03/2020, 18:56 - Enny J: To be sincere, in terms of economy
Nigeria is ranked first
14/03/2020, 18:56 - Ayodele Adewale: That's why they appointed Obi Ezekwesili head of thier economic team
14/03/2020, 18:58 - Babayomi: Yes
14/03/2020, 18:58 - Olisa: I thought it was Ngozi Okonju-iweala
14/03/2020, 18:59 - Enny J: Just that our Gdp ain't complementing our population
14/03/2020, 18:59 - Enny J: Look at countries with large population
Their Gdp can cause goosebumps
14/03/2020, 18:59 - Enny J: Even country with small population, their Gdp are high
14/03/2020, 19:00 - Korede: Like Brazil bah?! 🌝
14/03/2020, 19:00 - Enny J: Apart from Brazil

14/03/2020, 19:01 - Okiki Bello: Watsup.. Ethiopia is far better than Nigeria oh
14/03/2020, 19:01 - Babayomi: Even USA's GDP is not top ranked
14/03/2020, 19:01 - Enny J: But guys, I am thinking something
Let's forget the topic please
14/03/2020, 19:02 - Okiki Bello: Not even head. Part of
14/03/2020, 19:02 - Enny J: 19.39 trillion
Are you kidding
14/03/2020, 19:02 - Babayomi: What number?
14/03/2020, 19:03 - Ayodele Adewale: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 19:03 - Okiki Bello: Ethiopia income is through Their airline. Ethiopian Airline
14/03/2020, 19:03 - Ayodele Adewale: https://www.africanexponent.com/post/9786-top-six-countries-with-the-biggest-gdp-in-africa
14/03/2020, 19:03 - Korede: Sure. Of course you know this. 😒
14/03/2020, 19:04 - Enny J: Ranked by IMF
14/03/2020, 19:04 - Enny J: But guys, I am thinking something
Let's forget the topic please
14/03/2020, 19:04 - Ayodele Adewale: Yeah because thier airline makes them more money than oil does for Nigeria
14/03/2020, 19:04 - Babayomi: My bad, just went to check
14/03/2020, 19:05 - Enny J: Okay boss
14/03/2020, 19:05 - Ayodele Adewale: Nigeria has the biggest economy 
The best GDP
14/03/2020, 19:06 - Ayodele Adewale: But Okiki is sure Kenya and Ethiopia are better
14/03/2020, 19:06 - Babayomi: GDP capital which is used to rank richest countries was what I had in mind
14/03/2020, 19:07 - Ayodele Adewale: When all they will show you is Adis Ababa or Nirobi
14/03/2020, 19:07 - Babayomi: *per capital
14/03/2020, 19:07 - Ayodele Adewale: Lemme check that
14/03/2020, 19:10 - Okiki Bello: Yes, ke.
14/03/2020, 19:10 - Enny J: Ohhh I did not check that
14/03/2020, 19:10 - Enny J: I am just tired of the whole argument
14/03/2020, 19:10 - Ayodele Adewale: Nigeria is 17th in Africa in that list

18/03/2020, 13:57 - Enny J: The time deh charge is when you just wanna know your faith, but when you are positive already, they must do it for you whether they like it or not, because you can spread the virus

18/03/2020, 13:59 - Ayodele Adewale: People only get tested when they start exhibiting possible signs of having the virus
18/03/2020, 14:00 - Korede: That's why the larger work has to be done my you and I. Self-Isolate if you feel you are showing symptoms. 
Take the necessary precautions.
18/03/2020, 14:00 - Korede: It is not possible to test thousands of people not to talk of Millions.
18/03/2020, 14:00 - Enny J: Camp has been suspended self

There are definitely more they dont know about it
18/03/2020, 14:03 - Prince: Did they all travel down to Nigeria
18/03/2020, 14:03 - Enny J: I just thank God say the new cases have been isolated and been treated


Now they should start gathering all the people they have come in contact with since they entered Nigeria
18/03/2020, 14:03 - Korede: Every case we ever got is from those travelling in.
18/03/2020, 14:03 - Enny J: At the moment, 8 are positive with it in Nigeria
18/03/2020, 14:04 - Prince: You see now
18/03/2020, 14:04 - Enny J: And more is likely to add to it
18/03/2020, 14:04 - Korede: Did those people not know better to stay in Isolation instead of bring the bloody virus here. Bunch of...
18/03/2020, 14:04 - Enny J: Including a 6 months old baby
18/03/2020, 14:04 - Korede: Why did they just get tested in the bloody UK or US
18/03/2020, 14:05 - Korede: Now Nigerians will go into unnecessary panic.
18/03/2020, 14:05 - Enny J: I guess they did not know they have it
So they were probably running to their country so as not to get the virus
18/03/2020, 14:06 - Enny J: If anybody coughs beside me 🏃🏽‍♂️
Even if it was your spit that choked you
18/03/2020, 14:07 - Korede: How did that work for them?

25/03/2020, 08:20 - Okiki Bello: Oh No. I pray he doesn't have. Our Presidential material
25/03/2020, 08:21 - Ayodele Adewale: Even Bubu has it from reports
25/03/2020, 08:25 - Okiki Bello: I still don't trust the source. Kemi Olunloyo
25/03/2020, 08:26 - Ayodele Adewale: I didn't see on Kemi's timeline first
25/03/2020, 08:29 - Okiki Bello: God will not let Bubu have it.
25/03/2020, 08:31 - Ayodele Adewale: I don't understand 
He already has it
25/03/2020, 10:50 - Timi: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

25/03/2020, 11:11 - Ayodele Adewale: I am actually serious
25/03/2020, 11:54 - Kolade FUOYE: Ahh.
25/03/2020, 12:29 - Okiki Bello: He is negative, na
25/03/2020, 12:35 - Orisa: Bubu is sick nd has gone into self isolation
25/03/2020, 12:36 - Okiki Bello: It might be his normal old age illness. Let's not forget his current age is his football age
25/03/2020, 12:36 - Orisa: All join
25/03/2020, 12:36 - Orisa: He is sha sick
25/03/2020, 12:37 - Okiki Bello: And it's not Corona!
25/03/2020, 12:37 - Orisa: Old age ooo

Corona

Na one thing go kill person
25/03/2020, 12:37 - Orisa: All I want is osinbanjo as President
25/03/2020, 12:37 - Orisa: I don't know
 How it will happen ooo
25/03/2020, 12:37 - Okiki Bello: 🤦🏽‍♂️
25/03/2020, 12:37 - Kolade FUOYE: So what should happen to Bubu?
25/03/2020, 12:37 - Okiki Bello: Might not happen..
25/03/2020, 12:38 - Orisa: Its not compulsory he dies sha
25/03/2020, 12:38 - Orisa: Shebi u r God
25/03/2020, 12:38 - Okiki Bello: He might resign!
25/03/2020, 12:38 - Okiki Bello: But Bubu has a record he wants to attain o
25/03/2020, 12:38 - Olisa: 😒
25/03/2020, 12:38 - Orisa: Nd osinbanjo is president 

Finish
25/03/2020, 12:39 - Orisa: That is if bubu can resign tho
25/03/2020, 12:39 - Okiki Bello: To be frank, Orisa. Buhari would finish this tenure
25/03/2020, 12:39 - Okiki Bello: Even if it means being in coma for the rest of the tenure
25/03/2020, 12:40 - Okiki Bello: What's doing this one? 🤷🏽‍♂
25/03/2020, 12:41 - Olisa: Is that how people resign? Especially when we are talking about our president
25/03/2020, 12:41 - Korede: Treason.
25/03/2020, 12:41 - SUG: 😌😌
25/03/2020, 12:42 - SUG: Big one
25/03/2020, 12:42 - Okiki Bello: Hmm. I meant about health. If his health can't be managed again, he might be asked to resign
25/03/2020, 12:43 - Osuya: Instead, dem go do by-election 
Abi no be 9ja we dey again?!
25/03/2020, 12:44 - Okiki Bello: For example, a president might be forced to resign if he is suffering from loss of memory
25/03/2020, 12:44 - Okiki Bello: Lmao..
25/03/2020, 12:44 - Olisa: Lol.. 
Is this first time he is falling sick? All those periods he was away for a longtime during his last tenure why didn't he resign?
25/03/2020, 12:44 - Osuya: Mind you, Osinbajo has been relegated to a level whr he's more-or-less irrelevant to dem in terms of taking charge of d country's affairs
25/03/2020, 12:45 - Okiki Bello: There are some health conditions that would force the senate to ask the president to resign
25/03/2020, 12:45 - SUG: It was not enough for resign
25/03/2020, 12:45 - Okiki Bello: But Orisa thinks Osinbajo can be made president
25/03/2020, 12:45 - Olisa: I hear you comrade Okiki
25/03/2020, 12:45 - Osuya: NA: Not applicable especially in Nigeria
25/03/2020, 12:45 - Okiki Bello: Those ones were minor health issues
25/03/2020, 12:46 - SUG: 😂😂😂
25/03/2020, 12:46 - SUG: It is na
25/03/2020, 12:46 - Okiki Bello: God forbid, our president gets involved in a serious accident and suffers memory loss. Is he going to continue?
25/03/2020, 12:47 - SUG: This issue is not even about them

We are all together in this
25/03/2020, 12:48 - Olisa: Unless what happened during Yar'dua time repeats itself.. and even with that, they might still manipulate against Osinbajo
25/03/2020, 12:48 - Osuya: A whole lot of people knew Yar'adua was dead long before he was announced dead, and not until Jonathan made a move to know his actual state of health b4 his wife and family decided to hand over power
25/03/2020, 12:49 - Osuya: How many of such instances av been recorded in Nigerian history
25/03/2020, 12:49 - Okiki Bello: Very sure
25/03/2020, 12:50 - Osuya: My simple point is that currently we don't av a constitution or senate, we only av ceremonial senators and leaders
25/03/2020, 12:50 - Okiki Bello: But if today Buhari is diagnosed of Alzheimer''s disease or dementia. That resignation oh. Straight up. But the cabals would cover it
25/03/2020, 12:51 - Okiki Bello: We just started democracy 20 years ago.
25/03/2020, 12:52 - Okiki Bello: We have had a few leaders and none have suffered serious health issues.
25/03/2020, 12:53 - Osuya: Dat of Yar'adua was wat
25/03/2020, 12:53 - Okiki Bello: He died and power was handed over
25/03/2020, 12:53 - Osuya: After hw many weeks
25/03/2020, 12:54 - Okiki Bello: And power was finally handed over.
25/03/2020, 12:54 - Olisa: Lol

We are even talking as if Buhari has been up and doing with the affairs of Nigeria.. is not the cabals that have been in charge even in his good health condition
25/03/2020, 12:54 - Osuya: And can u compare Buhari to Yar'adua
25/03/2020, 12:54 - Okiki Bello: If Buhari dies today. Handing over power would be tough
25/03/2020, 12:56 - Okiki Bello: Our president has been been diagnosed with Corona virus. He contacted it in Germany where hex went to discuss our electricity problems. He has been flown to Lagos to treatment. If you know, you know.
25/03/2020, 12:57 - Okiki Bello: They are different, pls.
25/03/2020, 12:57 - Osuya: Do u believe dat Buhari myt be dead in dis country for a year and ntin will happen. 
Even though constitutionally, absence should be for 5/6 max or so
25/03/2020, 12:57 - Okiki Bello: I know.
25/03/2020, 12:57 - Okiki Bello: The cabals are so powerful, fah.
25/03/2020, 12:58 - Osuya: Now, u get my point 
Thanks!
25/03/2020, 12:58 - Okiki Bello: I totally get your point.
25/03/2020, 12:58 - Olisa: Lol.
You need cane
25/03/2020, 12:58 - Okiki Bello: The senate president is a man that would say yes to everything.
25/03/2020, 12:59 - Okiki Bello: To everything the presidency wants.
25/03/2020, 12:59 - Okiki Bello: I totally get your point.
25/03/2020, 12:59 - Okiki Bello: But my point is that, in saner climes, the President would have been forced to resign.
25/03/2020, 13:00 - Ayodele Adewale: Buhari has corona
25/03/2020, 13:00 - Okiki Bello: Where is your source?
25/03/2020, 13:00 - Ayodele Adewale: If he dies Osibanjo becomes president
25/03/2020, 13:00 - Osuya: If there's to be a protest on the streets for him to resign, would u join?!
25/03/2020, 13:00 - Okiki Bello: Or what is your source?
25/03/2020, 13:00 - Ayodele Adewale: There's nothing they can do about it
25/03/2020, 13:01 - Okiki Bello: I am the only son of my father.
25/03/2020, 13:01 - Okiki Bello: BB... 🤦🏽‍♂️
25/03/2020, 13:01 - Osuya: If dey declare him dead for d first 5/6 months at d least
25/03/2020, 13:01 - Okiki Bello: You don't think it would be that easy!
25/03/2020, 13:02 - Osuya: U see! 
Who go cm go force am den
25/03/2020, 13:02 - Okiki Bello: No fucking body, bro
25/03/2020, 13:02 - Okiki Bello: See. I am saying that the country is fucked.
25/03/2020, 13:03 - Okiki Bello: War would start!
25/03/2020, 13:03 - Korede: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 13:03 - Korede: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 13:04 - Ayodele Adewale: Which stupid war
25/03/2020, 13:04 - Osuya: See ehn, personally ooo
For years now I've lost hope in our political system dat has made me stop watching or listening to anything politics on TV or radio.
25/03/2020, 13:04 - Okiki Bello: Things might improve oh. The North won't agree.
25/03/2020, 13:05 - Ayodele Adewale: You people will be talking  anyhow
25/03/2020, 13:05 - Ayodele Adewale: It's in the constitution
25/03/2020, 13:05 - Okiki Bello: The North would start the agenda of that was what they did for Yaradua. They would want to be the ones to complete the term. And it would be influenced by the cabals.
25/03/2020, 13:06 - Okiki Bello: Like as if the constitution is being followed like that!
25/03/2020, 13:06 - Ayodele Adewale: The heat the north will do is shout  they want 2023
25/03/2020, 13:06 - Ayodele Adewale: Which part of it are they not following
25/03/2020, 13:07 - Ayodele Adewale: *most
25/03/2020, 13:07 - Okiki Bello: One instance: You realize that the constitution says that whenever the president leaves the country. The vice can act in capacity of the president.
25/03/2020, 13:08 - Korede: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 13:09 - Okiki Bello: 🤣🤣
25/03/2020, 13:09 - Ayodele Adewale: There is a specific number of days if I am not mistaking
25/03/2020, 13:11 - Okiki Bello: The last time the president travelled to UK for purposes we don't understand. There's was some papers that have to be signed. Buhari was in UK, VP was in Nigeria. Chief of staff was in Nigeria. But they had chief of staff fly the documents to meet Baba to sign. What's the VP's use?
25/03/2020, 13:13 - Okiki Bello: Isn't it in the constitution that the VP can act in the capacity of the President if the president is not around.
25/03/2020, 13:13 - SUG: Straight
25/03/2020, 13:14 - SUG: Seriously all this Nigeria is this and that

That is how yaradua died
Jonathan became president straight up
25/03/2020, 13:15 - SUG: All this Nigeria has cabal this and that
25/03/2020, 13:15 - SUG: It is not my prayer for the president to die thou, and any other officials
25/03/2020, 13:15 - SUG: In fact I want all this nonsense should stop
25/03/2020, 13:16 - Okiki Bello: So, there are no cabals ola?
25/03/2020, 13:17 - SUG: Politically there is cabal

How is the going to stop the constitution
25/03/2020, 13:17 - Osuya: Bros, Yar'adua had died weeks b4 he was announced dead and it was even cos Jonathan made a move 
By law, if Bubu dies, Osinbajo would be sworn in 
Bt d thing is these guys won't announce him dead immediately till dey av satisfied dia thirst for power
25/03/2020, 13:18 - Okiki Bello: I understand your optimism about Nigeria.
25/03/2020, 13:18 - SUG: I expect them not to do that immediately thou, which is very wrong 

And the thirst for power is not going to shift anything
25/03/2020, 13:18 - SUG: There was cabal then
Jonathan still became president
25/03/2020, 13:19 - Okiki Bello: But Osinbajo has been relegated by Cabals. The decisions he made when he was acting president didn't sit well with the cabals.

Even Aisha said there were cabals.
25/03/2020, 13:19 - Ayodele Adewale: Ya'ardua case was peculiar
25/03/2020, 13:19 - Okiki Bello: They weren't too obvious, Ola.
25/03/2020, 13:19 - SUG: How okiki
25/03/2020, 13:19 - Ayodele Adewale: I am driving when I stop I'll explain
25/03/2020, 13:20 - Okiki Bello: And you can't call them cabals. Just Godfathers and people who supported the campaign in exchange for favours
25/03/2020, 13:20 - Okiki Bello: They don't decide what happens.
25/03/2020, 13:20 - SUG: You better put off data before I get you 😂😂
25/03/2020, 13:20 - Okiki Bello: If they decide what happens then Obasanjo wouldn't have been annoyed with Jonathan for not listening to him
25/03/2020, 13:21 - Osuya: Dey wey obvious actually but let's say PDP's cabal is more God fearing dan APC's cabal
25/03/2020, 13:21 - SUG: What are u saying bayi
25/03/2020, 13:21 - Korede: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 13:21 - SUG: What is more God fearing

25/03/2020, 13:24 - Okiki Bello: I think he is going to explain what he means by that.
25/03/2020, 13:24 - Okiki Bello: Yes.. True.
25/03/2020, 13:24 - Osuya: E dey be me like say make thunder strike kill all of them
25/03/2020, 13:24 - Korede: Me too ooo. 🤣

25/03/2020, 13:29 - Okiki Bello: Ah
25/03/2020, 13:29 - Ayodele Adewale: To start with cabal can't stop the constitution
25/03/2020, 13:30 - Ayodele Adewale: Then to answer you Okiki when a President travels is completely different from when a president is deemed medically incapable of performing the duties of a president
25/03/2020, 13:30 - SUG: 😂😂😂😂
😂😂
Mumu boy
25/03/2020, 13:31 - Ayodele Adewale: When a President travels and the number of days he is going to spend out of the country is going to impede governance
25/03/2020, 13:31 - Okiki Bello: I said when a president travels for a period of time. His Vice president can act for him. And sign papers, attend meetings on his behalf
25/03/2020, 13:31 - Ayodele Adewale: He has to write to the Senate granting the Vice the powers of the president 
Only then can the Vice act
25/03/2020, 13:32 - Ayodele Adewale: If you had being patient you would have seen the rest of the message
25/03/2020, 13:32 - Okiki Bello: Okay, sir!
25/03/2020, 13:33 - Ayodele Adewale: The only time the Vice can act in place of the president without the letter is if house seems the president unfit or of being absent for too long
25/03/2020, 13:33 - Korede: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 13:33 - Ayodele Adewale: When Buhari was out of the country for over 100 days 
It was only when he wrote to the Senate that Osibanjo could act
25/03/2020, 13:34 - Osuya: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 13:34 - Korede: BB reminds me of my dad. The way they explain things to you ehn, it is painful. 🤣
25/03/2020, 13:34 - Osuya: Are u feeling d pain?
25/03/2020, 13:35 - Ayodele Adewale: And you are right one thing there are cabals and they had tried to ruin the relationship between Buhari and Osibanjo 
But after his first time as Acting 
Buhari trusts him
25/03/2020, 13:36 - Ayodele Adewale: The current link the cabal has to President is the person that infected him and that's Kyari
25/03/2020, 13:37 - Korede: Abajo
25/03/2020, 13:37 - SUG: Ode nie
25/03/2020, 13:38 - Ayodele Adewale: Kyari isn't being treated or isolated in Aso rock
25/03/2020, 13:39 - Ayodele Adewale: Because the ICU there is holding Bubu
25/03/2020, 13:41 - Ayodele Adewale: Then why Ya'ardua's case is a bit different is he was poisoned
25/03/2020, 13:42 - Ayodele Adewale: Then he was being treated outside the country and his wife made sure nobody had access to him
25/03/2020, 13:42 - Korede: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 13:43 - Ayodele Adewale: So nobody really knew how bad it was
25/03/2020, 13:43 - SUG: No one to trust
25/03/2020, 13:43 - Ayodele Adewale: Exactly
25/03/2020, 13:43 - Ayodele Adewale: But at the point he was confirmed dead and the news got into the country
25/03/2020, 13:44 - Ayodele Adewale: Good luck was sworn in and he picked his deputy as stated in the constitution
25/03/2020, 13:44 - Ayodele Adewale: The major noise then was that the wife did not let anybody she didn't trust see his body
25/03/2020, 13:44 - Osuya: Abeg, wen will dey instruct d private sector workers to stay at home 
At least, we should honour our president
25/03/2020, 13:45 - Okiki Bello: Is he dead?
25/03/2020, 13:45 - Ayodele Adewale: But Buhari is here in the country and with the way news leaks
If he dies there's no way they can hide it
25/03/2020, 13:45 - Ayodele Adewale: And once it's confirmed
25/03/2020, 13:45 - Okiki Bello: If Buhari dies, Osinbajo becomes president. No doubt.

19/04/2020, 20:04 - Enny J: Bruce
19/04/2020, 20:04 - Babayomi: FFP go still affect them somehow, might not be now but eventually
19/04/2020, 20:04 - Okiki Bello: He can't put that lot of money down now
19/04/2020, 20:04 - Enny J: <Media omitted>

19/04/2020, 20:05 - Enny J: When it will eventually affect them, they will be balanced by then
19/04/2020, 20:05 - Enny J: No be when you don spend finish FFP go come in play?
19/04/2020, 20:06 - Okiki Bello: The FFP rule is that you mustn't spend above your profit or so?
19/04/2020, 20:06 - Okiki Bello: They need to sell big if they are too spend 200 million
19/04/2020, 20:07 - Okiki Bello: And they don't have players worth 60 or 70 million
19/04/2020, 20:08 - Osuya: Dey are looking at employing Allegri
19/04/2020, 20:08 - Enny J: They just purchased the club
So the values of the new owner will be added
If the FFP will come in play, something would have been said about it 
So there is no profit

Or am I mistaken something
19/04/2020, 20:08 - Okiki Bello: I don't know..
19/04/2020, 20:09 - Okiki Bello: Wow..

19/04/2020, 20:28 - Enny J: Ohhh
How does it work?
19/04/2020, 20:30 - Ayodele Adewale: You can't use the owners money to buy players
19/04/2020, 20:30 - Ayodele Adewale: When City was bought there were no finicial fair play rules
19/04/2020, 20:31 - Ayodele Adewale: So they could rely on owners cash kinda
19/04/2020, 20:32 - Ayodele Adewale: The thing the owners can do is invest in the club 
Renovate the stadium
Renovate the facilities
Get sponsorship deals
19/04/2020, 20:32 - Enny J: Ohhh okay
I never knew, thanks
19/04/2020, 20:34 - Ayodele Adewale: But doesn't mean they can't cook the books sha
19/04/2020, 20:34 - Okiki Bello: This message was deleted
19/04/2020, 20:34 - Ayodele Adewale: If they do so 
They will be caught eventually
19/04/2020, 20:35 - Ayodele Adewale: Which is exactly what happened to City
19/04/2020, 20:35 - Ayodele Adewale: If not for financial fair play rules clubs like city and psg would have been practically untouchable
19/04/2020, 20:37 - Enny J: Lol, I know right
19/04/2020, 20:38 - Ayodele Adewale: Plus United uses club money not the owner's money 
The owner's of United even take money out of the club
19/04/2020, 20:39 - Enny J: From the screenshot I posted, they said they have submitted financial report to premier league, they are just waiting for approval so they can hand the money (200 million) to the coach when season starts
19/04/2020, 20:39 - Okiki Bello: Goan read again.

19/04/2020, 20:41 - Enny J: More than 150million will still go for players
19/04/2020, 20:42 - Enny J: I just believe they might have added facilities, so as to make it easy for the premier league guys to approve
19/04/2020, 20:42 - Enny J: Newcastle stadium is among the biggest in premier league
19/04/2020, 20:42 - Enny J: So they can't even to major renovation, just minor ones
19/04/2020, 20:42 - Okiki Bello: Club facilities can mean the stadium seats, pitch.

Make them state of art
Revamp the youth system
19/04/2020, 20:45 - Okiki Bello: This could take the whole 200 million
19/04/2020, 20:45 - Ayodele Adewale: Plus this cash they are allowed to buy into the club cause they just bought it
It's like start up capital
19/04/2020, 20:46 - Ayodele Adewale: But after this thier personal money can't be used on players legally
19/04/2020, 20:51 - Korede: <Media omitted>

20/04/2020, 20:29 - Korede: WTI though.
20/04/2020, 20:31 - Korede: For USA. I learnt Nigeria still at $12/barrel
20/04/2020, 20:33 - Ayodele Adewale: The oil market is just crazy currently
20/04/2020, 20:34 - Babayomi: We shud nt be buying petrol more than #80/90
20/04/2020, 20:36 - Ayodele Adewale: Depends on what Brent crude is selling for
20/04/2020, 20:37 - Korede: Real Crazy man.
20/04/2020, 20:39 - Korede: $26
20/04/2020, 20:39 - Korede: World.
20/04/2020, 20:43 - Ayodele Adewale: And ours Bonny is selling for about $22
20/04/2020, 20:44 - Okiki Bello: So ours is $22?
20/04/2020, 20:44 - Ayodele Adewale: Yep
20/04/2020, 20:44 - Ayodele Adewale: It's the American variant that has crashed below $1
20/04/2020, 20:48 - Ayodele Adewale: The problem though is nobody is buying oil
20/04/2020, 20:48 - Korede: Yes.
20/04/2020, 20:49 - Korede: There is surplus.
20/04/2020, 20:49 - Korede: Saudi and Russia beef, in addition to World "lockdown".
20/04/2020, 20:49 - Korede: 2020 is the GOAT year
20/04/2020, 21:01 - Babayomi: Actually thought we were producing Brent crude
20/04/2020, 21:01 - Babayomi: So it's the kind they produce in North America that dropped
20/04/2020, 21:02 - Babayomi: So producers started paying buyers to keep them, it's just crazy
20/04/2020, 21:03 - Ayodele Adewale: This has been settled
20/04/2020, 21:03 - SUG: This should be the issue
20/04/2020, 21:04 - Ayodele Adewale: Yeah
20/04/2020, 21:04 - Ayodele Adewale: We produce Bonny
20/04/2020, 21:05 - Babayomi: Just went to read about them online
20/04/2020, 21:06 - Okiki Bello: Link. Maybe i can understand that. The one have been reading looks complex
20/04/2020, 21:10 - Babayomi: Just go to twitter trend list, you'll find smtn simple to understand
20/04/2020, 21:10 - Korede: Due to lockdown. For examples Most Airlines are inactive.
20/04/2020, 21:11 - Korede: Can't happen.
20/04/2020, 21:11 - Korede: At least for now.
20/04/2020, 21:11 - SUG: Nobody is buying fuel at the moment
20/04/2020, 21:11 - Korede: Rather nobody is buying enough.
20/04/2020, 21:12 - Babayomi: When PMB reduced the pump price to #125, some analysts said it shud have been further reduced to about #90
20/04/2020, 21:12 - SUG: Yap
20/04/2020, 21:12 - Babayomi: Before all these corona wahala, I believe oil price per barrel was btw $40-50
20/04/2020, 21:13 - Korede: I am sure they didn't forsee this.
20/04/2020, 21:13 - Babayomi: So no reason we shud not be buying for a lesser price
20/04/2020, 21:14 - Korede: I am not an expert so I can say.
20/04/2020, 21:14 - Korede: *can't
20/04/2020, 21:15 - Babayomi: It will be interesting to see how things unfold sha
20/04/2020, 21:15 - Korede: True.
20/04/2020, 21:15 - SUG: Very true
20/04/2020, 21:17 - Korede: What I believe or know is this... 
If a Barrel of crude is 15 dollars, and the cost to produce it is let's say 8 dollars... 
Since Nigeria doesn't have refinery, we'd still have to pay for our crude to be refined to the various by products...
20/04/2020, 21:18 - Korede: After which comes the petrol and what not we use. I think that's where the issue of subsidy comes in, in the cost of production.
20/04/2020, 21:19 - Korede: But I'm not entirely sure. This is just what I think.
20/04/2020, 21:19 - Korede: I just hope all gets well soon enough.
20/04/2020, 21:26 - Ayodele Adewale: The cost of refining and transporting  is what makes petrol costly
20/04/2020, 21:27 - Babayomi: Yeah, we shud be buying for way less if only we could refine ourselves
20/04/2020, 21:29 - SUG: Refining yourself would have beaten the cost
20/04/2020, 21:30 - Ayodele Adewale: Wouldn't still be as cheap as you guys think
20/04/2020, 21:31 - SUG: So some countries still control the oil price 🤔
20/04/2020, 21:32 - Ayodele Adewale: You do realise Nigeria is part of those countries ba
20/04/2020, 21:32 - SUG: Sure
20/04/2020, 21:32 - SUG: Oil producing countries
20/04/2020, 21:34 - Korede: <Media omitted>

Good evening, trust you are keeping safe😁.

A couple of weeks ago, I decided to use a talent God has given me and making it to something everyone can have a feel of. I went to a studio and recorded a song
I pray you are blessed by it, the link is below. Also do well and share with friends so they are blessed too. 
Thanks.
